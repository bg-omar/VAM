    \subsection*{Abstract}
    The Casimir effect, a hallmark of quantum vacuum fluctuations, has traditionally been described through electromagnetic wave propagation constrained by boundary conditions. Within the Æther Dynamics Model, these fluctuations are reinterpreted as vortex-driven phenomena characterized by the maximum angular velocity $C_e$ and the Coulomb barrier radius $R_c$. This article critically examines the substitution of the universal speed of light $c$ with an effective velocity:
    \begin{equation*}
        c_{\text{effective}} = \frac{C_e}{r_c}.
    \end{equation*}
    This reformulation offers novel theoretical predictions and experimental implications while challenging classical paradigms.

    \subsection*{Introduction}
    The Casimir effect, observed as an attractive force between two parallel, uncharged conducting plates in vacuum, arises due to the quantized nature of vacuum electromagnetic fields. Traditionally, this force depends explicitly on $c$, the speed of light, a cornerstone of classical electrodynamics. The Æther Dynamics Model reimagines vacuum fluctuations as manifestations of vortex dynamics, where $C_e$ defines the angular velocity of these vortices and $R_c$ denotes their characteristic length scale. This shift necessitates a reconsideration of the role of $c$ and the resulting implications for physical laws.

    \subsection*{Traditional Casimir Effect}
    The classical Casimir force is expressed as:
    \begin{equation*}
        F = -\frac{\pi^2 \hbar c}{240 a^4},
    \end{equation*}
    where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $a$ is the separation between the plates. This result assumes uniform propagation of electromagnetic modes, restricted by the plates' boundary conditions.

    \subsection*{Effective Velocity in the Æther Model}
    In the Æther framework, the propagation speed of vacuum fluctuations is replaced by:
    \begin{equation*}
        c_{\text{effective}} = \frac{C_e}{r_c},
    \end{equation*}
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $C_e$ represents the maximum angular velocity of the Æther's vortex dynamics.
        \item $R_c$ defines the characteristic scale of vortex structures.
    \end{itemize}
    This substitution reflects the redefinition of vacuum energy propagation as a function of vortex mechanics rather than classical wave theory.

    \subsection*{Derivation of the Modified Casimir Force}
    Substituting $c$ with $c_{\text{effective}}$ in the classical Casimir force formula results in:
    \begin{equation*}
        F = -\frac{\pi^2 \hbar}{240 a^4} \cdot c_{\text{effective}},
    \end{equation*}
    where:
    \begin{equation*}
        c_{\text{effective}} = \frac{C_e}{r_c}.
    \end{equation*}
    Rewriting explicitly, we obtain:
    \begin{equation*}
        F = -\frac{\pi^2 \hbar}{240 a^4} \cdot \frac{C_e}{r_c}.
    \end{equation*}
    This formulation maintains the $1/a^4$ dependence inherent in the Casimir effect while introducing scaling factors that reflect the Æther model's dynamics. Specifically:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The numerator, $C_e$, represents the angular velocity of vortex fluctuations.
        \item The denominator, $R_c$, acts as a spatial scaling parameter, directly influencing the magnitude of the force.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection*{Key Steps in the Derivation}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Classical Vacuum Energy Density:} The energy density between plates due to vacuum fluctuations is proportional to:
        \begin{equation*}
            E \propto \int_0^\infty \omega(k) dk,
        \end{equation*}
        where $\omega(k) = c k$ is the mode frequency for wavevector $k$. In the Æther model, this frequency is replaced by $\omega(k) = c_{\text{effective}} k$.
        \item \textbf{Boundary Conditions:} Boundary conditions imposed by the plates restrict allowed modes, quantizing $k$. The modification introduces a dependency on $C_e$ and $R_c$.
        \item \textbf{Integration over Allowed Modes:} Summing over discrete modes, the effective vacuum energy density becomes:
        \begin{equation*}
            E_{\text{eff}} \propto \frac{C_e}{r_c} \cdot \int_0^\infty k dk.
        \end{equation*}
        This modified density leads directly to the new force formula.
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection*{Challenges and Limitations}
    While dimensionally consistent, the substitution of $c$ with $c_{\text{effective}}$ raises significant questions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Physical Scope:} The universal constancy of $c$ is well-supported by experimental data, while $c_{\text{effective}}$ applies exclusively within the vortex-dominated regime of the Æther model.
        \item \textbf{Contextual Validity:} The substitution holds only when vortex dynamics dominate, potentially invalid in weak vorticity fields or large-scale systems.
        \item \textbf{Experimental Verification:} Detectable deviations at atomic scales are required to validate $c_{\text{effective}}$.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection*{Implications and Experimental Prospects}
    The modified Casimir force introduces testable predictions that diverge from classical expectations. Potential experiments include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item High-precision force measurements to determine whether the $1/a^4$ scaling deviates at subatomic separations.
        \item Examining how boundary material properties influence Æther-induced forces.
    \end{itemize}
    Successful experimental validation of $c_{\text{effective}}$ would revolutionize our understanding of vacuum fluctuations and support the broader applicability of the Æther model.

    \subsection*{Conclusion}
    The reinterpretation of the Casimir effect within the Æther Dynamics Model challenges foundational assumptions of quantum field theory. By substituting $c$ with $c_{\text{effective}}$, we explore a framework in which vacuum fluctuations arise from vorticity fields rather than electromagnetic wave propagation. This shift not only provides theoretical insights but also opens experimental avenues for probing the microstructure of vacuum energy. Empirical validation or refutation of these predictions will be pivotal in determining the model's legitimacy and its potential to bridge classical and quantum descriptions of reality.

I have uploaded three documents. Please perform the following task:
1.  **Rules Document**: The file `Swirl_String_Theory_CANON-0.3.1.pdf` contains the master rules, definitions, and notational conventions of Swirl String Theory. You must treat this as the final authority on all principles and terminology.
2.  **Correction Document**: The file `VAM_SST_Rosetta.pdf` acts as a translation and correction guide. It contains specific changes, updates, or clarifications that must be applied to the source document.
3.  **Source Documents**: **All other uploaded PDF files**  is the primary text I want you to summarize.

**Your Task:**
First, fully understand the instructions from the **Rules Document** and the **Correction Document**.
Then, for each **Source Document**, read its content and apply the necessary corrections and rules.
Finally, produce a single, unified summary that synthesizes the corrected information from **all of the source documents**. The final output should read as a coherent overview of the collective knowledge contained in the source papers, presented according to the principles of the canonical and rosetta files.

# 🌀 Vortex Æther Model (VAM)

Welcome to the theoretical fringes.

This repository hosts a collection of exploratory papers, simulations, and visualizations centered around the **Vortex Æther Model (VAM)** — a fluid-dynamical reinterpretation of gravity, time dilation, and quantum phenomena. VAM posits that all fundamental interactions emerge from variations in a universal, superfluid-like æther, driven by topological vortex structures.

> Because if spacetime can curve, why can’t it swirl?

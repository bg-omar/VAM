# üåÄ Vortex √Üther Model (VAM)

Welcome to the theoretical fringes.

This repository hosts a collection of exploratory papers, simulations, and visualizations centered around the **Vortex √Üther Model (VAM)** ‚Äî a fluid-dynamical reinterpretation of gravity, time dilation, and quantum phenomena. VAM posits that all fundamental interactions emerge from variations in a universal, superfluid-like √¶ther, driven by topological vortex structures.

> Because if spacetime can curve, why can‚Äôt it swirl?

## üìñ Papers and Simulation Projects
This repository contains a series of papers and simulation projects that explore the Vortex √Üther Model, its implications for gravity, time dilation, and quantum mechanics, and how it contrasts with traditional spacetime theories. Each paper builds on the previous work, creating a comprehensive framework that challenges established paradigms. DOI are shown for each release.

> Because if you can‚Äôt visualize your theory, is it even real?

## üìù Equation Extraction

Run the helper script to harvest equations from each VAM paper and convert them
into Python-friendly expressions.  `VAM - 2 Swirl Clocks` was processed first,
and running the tool again will generate JSON files for the other folders
(including the English translation in `VAM - 1 TimeDilation/TimeDilation`):

```bash
python tools/extract_equations.py
```

The Swirl Clocks equations are stored in `out/extracted_equations.json`.  All
other VAM directories produce their own JSON files inside `out/equations/`, with
names derived from the directory titles (spaces replaced with underscores).
These files can be imported in tests or further analysis.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project may cause mild academic rage, spontaneous fluid metaphors, or a strong desire to challenge Einstein to a swirl-off. Reader discretion is advised.

\begin{abstract}

    This paper re-examines the concept of the æther through the evolving lens of Einstein’s philosophical reflections, culminating in a structured reinterpretation via the Vortex Æther Model (VAM). Contrary to the popular view that Einstein abolished the æther, his post-1920 writings explicitly reinstate it as a necessary medium — one that possesses field-like properties but lacks mechanical motion. We trace this conceptual evolution from the 1905 rejection of the luminiferous æther to the 1924 Einstein–Cartan correspondence, highlighting a shift toward a non-material, yet physically active, substrate.

    Building on this foundation, the VAM proposes a physically structured æther modeled as an incompressible, inviscid superfluid, in which gravity and inertia arise from quantized circulation of knotted vortex filaments. Vorticity replaces curvature as the geometric substrate of gravitation, and conserved angular momentum within the æther gives rise to time dilation, mass-energy equivalence, and inertial response. The model introduces effective mass \( M_{\text{eff}}(r) \) derived from localized vortex energy, and a rotational potential \( \Omega \) governing swirl-based gravitational analogs.

    We present a fluid-dynamic reinterpretation of time dilation, inertial mass, and gravitational analogs, introducing a rotational potential \( \Omega \) and effective mass \( M_{\text{eff}}(r) \). To bridge quantum and macroscopic scales, a hybrid coupling function \( G_{\text{hybrid}}(r) \) is defined, transitioning smoothly between swirl-based and Newtonian gravity via:
    \[
        G_{\text{hybrid}}(r) = \mu(r) G_{\text{swirl}} + (1 - \mu(r)) G, \quad \mu(r) = \exp\left(-\frac{r^2}{R_0^2}\right).
    \]

    This sets a philosophical and mathematical groundwork for the VAM framework, in which classical and quantum properties of matter emerge from topological dynamics in a physical æther. These dynamics are further structured by a layered temporal ontology introduced in later sections, distinguishing absolute, proper, and swirl-based time modes (\( \mathcal{N}, \tau, S(t) \)) within the ætheric framework.
    For validation of VAM predictions against classical tests of general relativity, see the benchmark analysis presented in~\cite{iskandarani2025benchmark}.

    \textbf{Author’s Note:} This work is not intended as a neutral historical analysis, but as a conceptual bridge framing VAM as a modern realization of Einstein’s late æther philosophy.

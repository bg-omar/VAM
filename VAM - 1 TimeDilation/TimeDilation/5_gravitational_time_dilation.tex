\section{Gravitational Time Dilation via Æther Flow}

In General Relativity, clocks deeper in a gravitational potential well run slower compared to those at higher potentials. We reproduce this result using æther flow fields instead of spacetime curvature. In the Vortex Æther Model, the effect is expressed as local variations in swirl field energy and æther inflow velocity.

\subsection*{5A. Æther Flow as Gravity}

We assume that mass $M$ induces an inward radial flow of æther. At a radius $r$, this flow speed is given by:
\[
v_g(r) = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}.
\]

    \label{fig:GravitationeleÆtherinstroom}
\end{figure}

This mirrors the Painlevé–Gullstrand metric and the river model of black holes~\cite{Hamilton2004-river}.

\subsection*{Æther Drag and Clock Slowdown}

A clock held at radius $r$ in this inward æther flow sees æther moving past it at speed $v_g(r)$. The vortex core's observed angular velocity is therefore reduced due to the æther's drag, just as in the special relativity case, where motion through æther reduces the observed clock rate.

Thus, the gravitational time dilation factor is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\tau}{dt} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{v_g^2(r)}{c^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}}.
\end{equation}

A notable implication of gravitational æther inflow is related to the maximum force principle, defined as $F^{\text{max}}_{\text{gr}} = c^4 /4G$. Physically, this represents the upper limit on æther drag forces, where the inward æther flow near gravitational horizons reaches velocities close to $c$. At the Schwarzschild radius, the inflow speed of æther matches this limit, effectively freezing the rotation of any vortex-based clocks due to extreme drag, thus providing a tangible fluid-mechanical interpretation of gravitational horizons.

This is consistent with the Schwarzschild solution for stationary observers in general relativity.

A precise confirmation of gravitational time dilation under controlled conditions was provided by the Gravity Probe A mission~\cite{vessot_levine_1980}, which launched a hydrogen clock to an altitude of 10,000 km.

This delay was not only derived theoretically, but was confirmed experimentally by Pound and Rebka in 1959, who measured a gravitationally induced frequency shift between two points at different altitudes within the Earth's gravitational field using the Mössbauer effect~\cite{pound_rebka_1959}.

\subsection*{Interpretation}

This equation means that the deeper a vortex is located in the gravitational potential (the faster the local æther flow), the slower it rotates from the perspective of an observer at infinity. At the Schwarzschild radius $r_s = 2GM/c^2$, $d\tau/dt = 0$: time stops for external observers.

This provides a mechanistic interpretation of gravitational redshift: light emitted by a vortex-clock in a strong potential well appears redshifted due to the slower angular motion of the emitting vortex. The result:
\[
\boxed{\frac{d\tau}{dt} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}}}
\]
is fully consistent with GR and supports the æther flow analogy~\cite{Schiller2022-maxforce}.

\subsection*{5B. Alternative Derivation via Swirl Tension Field}

The same dilation can be derived using the generalized topological swirl field from Section~\ref{sec:generalized_dilation}. Let $\Phi(\vec{x})$ be the swirl energy density due to curvature of vortex cores or gravitational tension. Then the local dilation becomes:

\[
\frac{d\tau}{d\mathcal{N}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{\Phi(\vec{x})}{\Phi_{\text{max}}}}
\]

This includes both the gravitational case and other scenarios where curvature increases vortex twist or core strain. For gravity, one may take $\Phi \sim GM/r$ or $\Phi \sim \Gamma^2/r^2$. This tension-driven dilation provides a unified formalism for gravitational and relativistic slowdown in VAM.

\subsection*{5C. Bernoulli Interpretation via Æther Pressure Gradients}

A third interpretation uses Bernoulli's law for superfluids. Here, gravitational potential is seen as a reduction in æther pressure near masses. According to Bernoulli's principle, a lower æther pressure corresponds to higher local flow speed and tension. This directly maps to vortex time dilation, and complements the inflow model by associating energy density with pressure drops.

Together, these views frame gravitational dilation as a result of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inward æther flow (kinematic drag),
    \item Vortex curvature energy (swirl tension),
    \item Æther pressure drop (fluid potential).
\end{itemize}

This confirms the robustness and physical interpretability of time dilation within the Vortex Æther Model.

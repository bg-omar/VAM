  "description": "This article presents a vortex-based reformulation of relativistic time dilation. By modeling space as an incompressible, inviscid 3D superfluid æther, the study derives time dilation laws using vortex core angular velocity instead of spacetime curvature. Clocks are represented as stable rotating vortex cores in the æther, and both special and general relativistic effects are recovered from fluid dynamic principles. The model produces a unified dilation formula involving the relative motion between the vortex and æther flow, suggesting a fluid-mechanical alternative to Einsteinian curvature with experimental implications.",

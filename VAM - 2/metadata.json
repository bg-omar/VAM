  "description": "This paper reformulates general relativity through fluid mechanics using the Vortex Æther Model (VAM). It shows how time dilation, mass, and gravity emerge from pressure gradients caused by structured vorticity in an incompressible, inviscid superfluid. The model replaces spacetime curvature with vortex dynamics and introduces quantized circulation, Bernoulli time dilation, and vortex-induced redshift as physical observables. Experimental analogs are proposed using superfluids and rotating systems.",

\subsection*{Overall Assessment}

\textbf{VAM Strengths:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accurately reproduces classical tests (redshift, light deflection, perihelion precession, frame-dragging) to first-order precision.
    \item Now includes gravitational radiation via compressible æther wave equations, matching GR’s quadrupole formula.
    \item Recovers geodetic (de Sitter) precession through vortex spin transport mechanisms.
    \item Matches GR ISCO radius when instability thresholds are added to the vortex swirl model.
    \item Offers a flat-space reinterpretation of gravity via vorticity-induced pressure and kinetic time dilation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Remaining Limitations (and Remedies):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Higher-order post-Newtonian corrections untested:} Derive full PN expansion from swirl field equations to verify extreme-field predictions.
    \item \textbf{Quantum regime modeling incomplete:} Transition to quantum scales (\( \mu(r) \)) and coupling to quantum æther behavior remain to be formalized.
    \item \textbf{No covariant formulation:} A general tensor-based Lagrangian for VAM would enable direct comparison to GR’s field equations and facilitate coupling to field theory.
    \item \textbf{Cosmological dynamics undeveloped:} Large-scale behavior (e.g., Hubble expansion, dark energy analogs) must be modeled using global æther flows.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Future Work}

To compete with and extend GR, the Vortex Æther Model should be expanded as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Extend vortex dynamics from static to fully dynamic, nonlinear æther perturbations.
    \item Develop a covariant Lagrangian or Hamiltonian field theory for structured vorticity.
    \item Integrate quantum æther fluctuations and entropic flows to describe mass generation and wavefunction evolution.
    \item Simulate vortex-based cosmology to test large-scale coherence and horizon-scale structure formation.
    \item Evaluate new predictions: e.g., frequency-dependent lensing, directional light-speed anisotropy, or testable æther drag in high-precision interferometry.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Conclusion}

The Vortex Æther Model has progressed from a conceptual fluid analogy to a quantitatively predictive framework. It now reproduces gravitational wave emission, gyroscopic precession, and ISCO-like behavior—phenomena previously thought to require curved spacetime. By replacing geometry with vorticity-induced pressure gradients, VAM explains gravitational dynamics in a flat 3D space with absolute time and structured æther.

\section{Recommendations and Conclusion}

To establish VAM as a viable gravitational theory, we recommend focusing on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Full numerical simulation of vortex knot dynamics in multi-body systems.
    \item Derivation of higher-order relativistic corrections from swirl field tensors.
    \item Extension to the quantum and cosmological domains using ætheric field quantization.
    \item Empirical tests that discriminate VAM from GR in yet-untested domains.
\end{itemize}

If these goals are met, VAM may serve not only as an alternative to general relativity but as a unifying model that connects gravitational phenomena with thermodynamic, fluid, and quantum structures in a fundamentally vorticity-driven universe.

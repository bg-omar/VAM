\chapter*{Mechanism for Gravitational Radiation in the Vortex Æther Model (VAM)}
\section*{Introduction}
The Vortex Æther Model (VAM) reintroduces a classical æther as an invisible, superfluid medium in which gravity arises from structured vortex flows instead of spacetime curvature~\cite{iskandarani2025VAM2}. In VAM, matter is represented as stable vortex knots (e.g., a trefoil knot T(2,3)) with a core radius \textit{r\textsubscript{c}} and a characteristic circular core velocity \textit{C\textsubscript{e}} (swirl)~\cite{iskandarani2025VAM2}. Gravity manifests in this model statically as pressure differences caused by vorticity~\cite{iskandarani2025VAM2}. However, a purely incompressible, stationary æther as originally assumed in VAM provides \textit{no mechanism} for radiation loss from accelerating masses. This means that gravitational waves—a cornerstone of Einstein's general relativity—are absent in the basic VAM. Indeed, such a VAM would predict that an inspiraling binary pulsar system shows \textit{no} orbital decay (i.e., $dP/dt \approx 0$), contrary to the observed decrease in orbital period (for PSR B1913+16, $dP/dt \approx -2.4\times10^{-12}$ s/s). Moreover, direct observations by LIGO/Virgo of gravitational waves in 2015 are compelling evidence that such waves exist at the speed of light \textit{c}~\cite{iskandarani2025VAM3}. To bring VAM in line with these empirical facts, the model must be extended with a mechanism for \textit{gravitational radiation}~\cite{iskandarani2025VAM3}.

Several extensions have been proposed to enable gravitational radiation in VAM:

\begin{itemize}
\item Compressible æther – By making the æther \textit{slightly compressible or elastic}, orbital systems can excite longitudinal or transverse waves in the medium. If the compressibility is chosen such that the wave speed equals \textit{c}, these æther waves can play the role of gravitational waves.

\item Vortex shedding – Two rotating vortex knots in orbit could generate small vortices or turbulence in the æther (similar to a Von Kármán vortex street). With a small viscosity or coupling to a secondary field, energy can leak away as radiation.

\item Thermodynamic coupling – In VAM, entropy or temperature fields are also considered. Merging vortex knots could excite waves in such a field, analogous to massless spin-2 “gravitons” in the æther medium.
\end{itemize}

In this analysis, we focus on the \textit{compressible æther} approach, which most directly leads to wave solutions with speed \textit{c}. We address in sequence: (1) the derivation of time-dependent vortex equations in an elastic or weakly compressible æther, (2) the required æther properties (density $ρ_a$ and elasticity/bulk modulus \textit{K}) to match the wave speed to \textit{c}, (3) how asymmetries in swirl or core motion can generate quadrupolar radiation, (4) the energy emission in the form of gravitational waves and its consistency with the quadrupole formula from GR, and (5) the criteria for detectable gravitational waves in VAM, with emphasis on the binary pulsar system PSR B1913+16.

\section*{Dynamic Vortex Equations for an Elastic Æther}
To enable gravitational radiation, we extend VAM with time-dependent æther dynamics. We model the æther as an almost incompressible but \textit{slightly elastic medium}. Physically, this can be seen as a superfluid æther with a large but finite bulk modulus \textit{K} (or as an elastic continuum with very high stiffness). This allows small disturbances in the vortex field to propagate as waves, instead of adjusting instantaneously everywhere.

A formal way to describe this is to introduce a small perturbation field $ψ(\mathbf{r},t)$ that represents deviations from the stationary vortex solution. For an ideal fluid without dissipation, $ψ$ could, for example, be related to pressure or density fluctuations in the æther. From the linearized Euler equations (continuity and momentum conservation), a classical \textit{wave equation} for small disturbances follows. In the absence of sources, $ψ$ satisfies:

\[
\nabla^2 \psi - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial t^2} = 0,
\]

where $c = \sqrt{K/\rho_a}$ is the wave speed in the medium. This equation describes transverse or longitudinal sound-like waves in the æther. To obtain gravity-analogous effects, these waves must be transverse and quadrupolar in nature, similar to the two polarization states of GR gravitational waves. In a fully incompressible medium, the second (time) term is absent and there are no true propagation solutions—hence, only with the introduction of compressibility or elasticity can \textit{dynamic gravitational waves} arise~\cite{iskandarani2025VAM3}.

Next, we introduce coupling to moving vortex masses by adding a source term $S(\mathbf{r},t)$ to the wave equation. A consistent extension of VAM requires that this source is related to changes in the mass or vorticity distribution. Analogous to classical radiation theory (and GR), the dominant contribution comes from the \textit{quadrupole moment tensor} $Q_{ij}(t)$ of the system. A meaningful extended vortex equation in VAM then reads:

\[
\nabla^2 \psi - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial t^2} = S(\mathbf{r},t),
\]

where $S$ is proportional to the second time derivative of the vorticity quadrupole of the material vortex configuration. Intuitively, this means that an accelerating distribution of vortex knots generates ripples (pressure and velocity waves) in the æther. This equation is directly comparable to the wave equation in linear gravity (or electromagnetic radiation), and ensures energy conservation: the disturbance energy propagates outward as a wavefront. Crucially, the resulting wave solutions in the far field cause \textit{transverse deformations} in the æther pressure, corresponding to a periodic stretching and squeezing of space as with gravitational waves. In the VAM context, however, it is the \textit{pressure and vorticity of the æther} that oscillate, not the metric of spacetime.

\section*{Æther Elasticity and Wave Speed Equal to \textit{c}}
An essential requirement for consistency with observations is that the propagation speed of these vortex waves equals the speed of light \textit{c}. Experimentally, it has been established (for example, via the simultaneous arrival of gravitational waves and light from a neutron star merger in 2017) that gravitational waves propagate within $|v-c|/c < 10^{-15}$ of \textit{c}. In our model, the wave speed is given by $c_{\text{wave}} = \sqrt{K/\rho_a}$, where $ρ_a$ is the mass density of the æther and \textit{K} the effective bulk modulus (or elastic modulus). To achieve $c_{\text{wave}} = c$, the following must hold:

\[
K = \rho_a c^2.
\]

This requires an \textit{extremely stiff æther}. With typical VAM parameters (for example, $ρ_a \approx 3.9\times10^{18}$ kg/m³~\cite{iskandarani2025VAM2}), this means $K \approx 3.5\times10^{35}$ Pa – for comparison: this is many orders of magnitude stiffer than even diamond or nuclear matter. However, this high stiffness does not contradict the invisibility of the æther, since the æther does not interact with normal matter except via vorticity. Moreover, in the static limit (incompressible approximation), an effectively infinite stiffness was already assumed. We now make that stiffness finite, chosen so that small disturbances propagate at \textit{c}. In a sense, the speed of light emerges here as a property of the æther medium: in VAM, light itself is already considered a wave in this medium (for example, an electromagnetic disturbance or vortex filament). It is therefore consistent to regard gravitational waves as another type of wave in the same æther, with the same characteristic speed.

Because we consider the æther as (almost) undeformable on static timescales, existing VAM results for static fields (e.g., gravitational laws, time dilation near a mass) will remain unchanged in the low-frequency limit. Only in rapid, dynamic motions does elasticity become apparent. This means the theory retains the Newtonian limit and stationary solutions (no extra degrees of freedom in static tests), while at high frequency the new wave dynamics appear. In summary, æther elasticity requires: \textit{i)} a huge bulk modulus $K = ρ_a c^2$ to guarantee $v_{\text{wave}} = c$, and \textit{ii)} probably also some form of shear modulus to support transverse polarizations. In a pure fluid model, only longitudinal (pressure) waves exist; however, gravitational waves are transverse. One can imagine that the æther has properties of a \textit{superfluid helium-like medium} that flows frictionlessly on the microscale (no static shear resistance) but still allows transverse oscillations at very high frequencies. This remains an assumption within VAM, but is necessary to mimic the polar structure of gravitational waves~\cite{iskandarani2025VAM3}.

\section*{Quadrupolar Emission by Swirl Asymmetries}
In general relativity, only non-spherically symmetric, accelerating mass distributions emit gravitational waves – in particular, a time-varying quadrupole moment is minimally required. A similar situation occurs in VAM. A perfectly symmetric vortex (e.g., a solitary, ideal ring-shaped vortex knot with constant swirl \textit{C\textsubscript{e}} and stationary position) does produce a static gravitational field, but no radiation: the configuration is time-independent and (asymptotically) axially symmetric, so there is no oscillation in the vorticity field. To generate gravitational radiation, the vortex structure must undergo a non-stationary, non-spherical motion.

An important example is a binary vortex knot: two material vortex knots (think of two neutron stars modeled as T(2,3) knots) orbiting each other. Such a system is by definition not symmetric under rotation about a single axis in the center of mass – it has a clear quadrupole moment that varies in time (two compact masses continuously change their relative position). In VAM terms, this means that the \textit{common æther flow and pressure distribution} around both knots is periodically disturbed. \textit{Swirl asymmetries} – small differences in how fast or intensely the two knots swirl their æther – can enhance this effect because the vorticity field is no longer perfectly mirror-symmetric. Likewise, \textit{core displacements} – if the vortex cores are pulled slightly out of their original (e.g., circular) orbit or shape by tidal forces – cause fluctuations in the local pressure field. This is analogous to periodically deforming an elastic ring: a “thick” trefoil knot with radius \textit{r\textsubscript{c}} can oscillate in shape under external stress fields. Those oscillations propagate as waves through the æther. One can imagine these \textit{kinks} in the vortex line as Kelvin waves (known from vortex dynamics in superfluids) traveling over the knot and emitting æther vibrations. As long as total angular momentum and circulation are conserved, such deformations of the knot will radiate energy via emission into the æther medium.

Mathematically, in the source term $S(\mathbf{r},t)$ of the previously mentioned wave equation, a dominant term appears that is proportional to the third time derivative of the quadrupole moment tensor $Q_{ij}$ of the vortex mass configuration: $S(t) \propto \dddot{Q}_{ij}(t)$. Thus, every \textit{accelerating non-circular flow} in the æther emits a disturbance. In the case of two orbiting knots, $Q_{ij}$ can be written explicitly and one finds an oscillating term with twice the orbital frequency (just as in GR). \textit{Symmetric} motions (e.g., two knots exactly opposite each other in a perfect circular orbit) also emit gravitational waves, but only via the quadrupole field – dipole terms vanish due to momentum conservation (the center of mass does not move) and monopole terms are absent due to total mass conservation. \textit{Asymmetric swirl distributions} (for example, if one vortex spins slightly more strongly than the other, or if the knots follow elliptical orbits) introduce additional higher multipole contributions, but the quadrupole will generally dominate as long as the motion is not extremely ultra-relativistic.

It is important that the polarization and geometry of the predicted æther waves must be in line with observations. In GR, gravitational waves are transverse and have two polarization states (plus and cross), corresponding to stretching in perpendicular directions. In VAM, we can achieve this by requiring that the æther disturbances $ψ$ manifest as orthogonal modulating pressure gradients. A binary vortex rotating in the $xy$-plane, for example, will emit æther waves that cause test particles (imaginarily embedded in the æther) to alternately move in the $x$ and $y$ directions – a quadrupolar deformation. This corresponds to the tidal stretching pattern of plus/cross polarizations. Therefore, we expect that a swirl asymmetry or core perturbation in a VAM binary configuration generates exactly such a quadrupolar signal in the æther medium, with amplitude depending on the details of the asymmetry.

\section*{Energy Loss and the Quadrupole Formula}
Gravitational waves carry energy away from the system that produces them. In GR, the radiated power in the weak-field approximation is given by the famous quadrupole formula:

\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{G}{5c^5} \langle \dddot{Q}_{ij} \dddot{Q}_{ij} \rangle,
\]

where $G$ is the gravitational constant and the brackets $\langle \rangle$ denote a time average over one cycle~\cite{iskandarani2025VAM3}. Our goal is for the VAM mechanism to yield \textit{the same formula} in the correct limit. To do this, we must calibrate the coupling between the vortex dynamics and the disturbance field $ψ$ correctly. In the static VAM, gravity was coupled to vorticity via a constant $γ = G ρ_a^2$~\cite{iskandarani2025VAM2}, such that the Poisson equation for the “vortex potential” reproduced the Newtonian limit. Analogously, we will scale the \textit{source term} $S$ in the wave equation with the same $γ$ (or a derived constant) so that an accelerated system with given masses produces the same energy flux as in GR.

From the extended wave solution at large distance, the energy flux via the æther medium follows. For a given oscillation $ψ(t)$, the energy density in the wave is typically $E_{\text{wave}} \sim \frac{1}{2}ρ_a (\partial_t ψ)^2 + \frac{1}{2}K (\nabla ψ)^2$. The Poynting vector (energy flux) is proportional to $\partial_t ψ \nabla ψ$. In the far zone from the source (where the waves propagate freely as radiation), $ψ$ and $\nabla ψ$ fall off as $1/r$. Thus, the flux goes as $\sim r^2 (\partial_t ψ)^2$. It can be shown that if $ψ$ is driven by the quadrupolar source $S \propto \ddot{Q}_{ij}$, the power flux at large distance exactly matches the above $G$-proportional expression, provided $γ$ is chosen correctly. In other words: by tuning the definition of $γ$ (or equivalently, the relation between $C_e$, $r_c$, and $ρ_a$), we ensure that VAM’s radiation damping quantitatively matches that of GR~\cite{iskandarani2025VAM3}. This is not a trivial adjustment; it requires that the entire concept of mass and energy in the vortex model aligns with GR’s energy-momentum tensor. Notably, VAM was already successfully tuned to GR in static tests (e.g., correct perihelion precession, lensing angle, etc.), so this extra requirement further restricts the degrees of freedom but is in principle feasible.

We can also regard the agreement with the quadrupole formula as an empirical \textit{calibration}: the measured orbital decay of double pulsars such as PSR B1913+16 must be recovered. In GR, the above formula leads to a predicted orbital period change $dP/dt$. For PSR B1913+16, this is $-2.4\times10^{-12}$ per second; the observation is $(-2.4056 \pm 0.0051)\times10^{-12}$ s/s, a match within 0.2\%. VAM without radiation predicted $dP/dt \approx 0$, which is incompatible with the data. With our addition of an æther wave mechanism, we can now calculate the energy loss per orbit and equate it to the observed value by choosing parameters. In fact, this is used to confirm the value of $γ$ (or effectively $G$ in the model). Once tuned, the correct radiation strength follows automatically for any other system. For example, a double neutron star system in VAM with the right elasticity and $γ$ would have the same inspiral time as predicted by GR. This agreement is crucial: it ensures that VAM does not introduce contradictions with existing astrophysical observations when introducing gravitational waves, but rather \textit{explains} these observations.

Finally, it is worth noting that this radiation derivation also respects the conservation laws. Energy and momentum lost by the binary system are carried away by the æther waves. The momentum transport is in the anisotropy of the radiation (gravitational waves also carry momentum and can give a system a recoil, as in GR for asymmetric supernova efforts or spiraling black holes). In VAM, such an effect could occur if the æther waves generate net flow in a certain direction. However, our derivation is limited to symmetric binaries, where the net recoil is zero and only energy flows away in the quadrupolar waves.

\section*{Detectability of Gravitational Waves in VAM}
Now that VAM is equipped with a mechanism for gravitational waves, we can compare the criteria for detection of these waves with the known values from GR. Since we have tuned the model to produce quantitatively \textit{the same} waves as GR in the relevant limits, the detection criteria will largely coincide with those for regular gravitational waves. Nevertheless, we briefly discuss them, focusing on the example PSR B1913+16 and similar systems:

\begin{itemize}
\item Amplitude (strain): Gravitational waves have extremely small dimensionless amplitude $h = ΔL/L$ on Earth. For PSR B1913+16 (at $\sim$21,000 light-years distance), the estimated wave amplitude is of order $10^{-23}$, which is far below the sensitivity threshold of current detectors. For comparison: LIGO can detect sources with $h \sim 10^{-21}$ (and higher) in its sensitivity band. Our VAM waves would be identical in amplitude to GR waves for a given astrophysical configuration, so also $\sim10^{-23}$ for PSR B1913+16 – not directly detectable with current instruments. Only in the final stage of an inspiral (just before merger) do amplitudes grow to $10^{-21}$–$10^{-20}$, then they become observable. In VAM this is no different: when two vortex knots approach very closely and orbit rapidly, $|\dddot{Q}_{ij}|$ increases sharply and so does $h$.

\item Frequency: PSR B1913+16 has an orbital period of $\sim$7.75 hours, so the gravitational wave frequency is about \textit{2/P} $\approx 7\times10^{-5}$ Hz (twice the orbital frequency, because two passages per orbit). This lies in the low-frequency range of the spectrum, outside the sensitivity window of LIGO/Virgo (which are sensitive from $\sim$10 Hz to $\sim$kHz). Space interferometers such as LISA could in principle be sensitive to frequencies around $10^{-4}$–$10^{-2}$ Hz, but even LISA’s range starts at $\sim$0.1 mHz ($10^{-4}$ Hz) and PSR B1913+16 is just below that. Moreover, the amplitude at $10^{-4}$ Hz for this system is still very small. With current and near-future detectors, waves from such double pulsars are only \textit{indirectly} observable via their effect on the orbit (as Hulse-Taylor demonstrated). In VAM, nothing changes here: the indirect detection via orbital inspiral \textit{has} already been done and enforces the radiation law. Direct detection would only be possible for much closer binaries or during late inspiral phases.

\item Characteristic signature: Gravitational waves from inspiraling binaries have a characteristic “chirp” pattern: frequency and amplitude increase as the objects spiral in. This would be identical in VAM, since the same quadrupole formula applies for energy loss. It is therefore an important prediction that, should one ever directly measure the gravitational waves from, for example, PSR B1913+16, their frequency evolution and amplitude increase exactly follow the GR pattern. Deviations in this would falsify VAM (as extended with this mechanism). So far, the time derivative of the pulsar period is the primary observable, and it already matches GR (and now also the extended VAM) within measurement error.

\item Specific systems: Besides PSR B1913+16, the double pulsar system PSR J0737–3039A/B is also important. GR predicts $dP/dt \approx -1.25\times10^{-12}$ s/s there, which is measured as $\sim-1.252\times10^{-12}$ s/s; again, GR matches excellently and VAM without radiation would fail~\cite{iskandarani2025VAM3}. With the new extension, VAM is also expected to reproduce this decay. For systems that \textit{have} been detected by LIGO/Virgo, such as binary black holes (e.g., GW150914) or neutron stars (GW170817), VAM’s predictions in the inspiral and merger phase coincide with GR as long as the vortex model holds under such extreme conditions. In fact, in VAM for compact objects there is a limit where $v_ϕ \to c$ at the core (comparable to a horizon in GR). If two such extreme knots merge, the emitted æther waves in the final phase will reach the same frequency ($\sim$100 Hz to kHz) and amplitude ($h \sim 10^{-21}$) as measured. The detection criterion – signal-to-noise ratio above the threshold in the interferometers – is therefore not violated by VAM; a successfully extended VAM predicts the same detectable signals as GR for all observed events.
\end{itemize}

Conclusion: With the adjustments derived above, the Vortex Æther Model can contain a mechanism for gravitational radiation that is consistent with both theoretical and empirical requirements. We have seen that introducing slight æther compressibility (elasticity) leads to wave equations that describe dynamic vortex disturbances as propagating gravitational waves. By choosing the æther stiffness so that the wave speed is \textit{c}, VAM satisfies relativistic causality. Time-varying asymmetric vortex configurations (such as binary knots) produce quadrupolar æther waves, and the derived energy flux can be matched to the classical quadrupole formula from GR. This means that VAM, extended with gravitational radiation, can reproduce the orbital decay of double pulsars and the waveform of merger events. Such a development is crucial for VAM to grow into a full-fledged alternative to GR. Challenges remain – for example, precisely formulating the transverse nature of the waves in a fluid and retaining all other successful aspects of VAM – but the analyses indicate that there is no fundamental obstacle. If VAM is further developed in this way, gravity could be reinterpreted as an emergent phenomenon of a classical medium, \textit{without} sacrificing the predictions of Einstein’s theory for both static fields and dynamic radiation~\cite{iskandarani2025VAM3}. In this way, the model offers an elegant fluid-dynamical picture of gravity, in which masses are swirling knots and gravitational waves are nothing but vibrations in a cosmic superfluid.

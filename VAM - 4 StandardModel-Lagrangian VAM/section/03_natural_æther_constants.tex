\section{Natural Æther Constants and Dimensional Reformulation}

The Vortex Æther Model (VAM) proposes a fundamental shift in how physical quantities are derived and interpreted. Rather than relying on constants introduced purely for dimensional self-consistency (as in Planck units), VAM defines a small set of physically grounded parameters that emerge from the topological and fluid-dynamical behavior of a compressible æther medium. These constants—accessible through theoretical analysis and analog systems—serve as the natural units for describing mass, energy, charge, and time.

The five central æther parameters are: the core swirl velocity $C_e$, vortex radius $r_c$, local æther density $\rho_\text{\ae}$, circulation quantum $\kappa$, and maximum transmissible force $F^{\text{\ae}}_{\text{max}}^{\text{vam}}$. Each of these is inferred from known or measurable features of matter and vortex dynamics:

- \textbf{Swirl Velocity $C_e$}: Estimated from simulations of stable quantized vortices in Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs), where core rotation frequencies yield swirl velocities on the order of $10^6$ m/s \cite{Pethick2008BEC, Kleckner2013KnottedVortices}.

- \textbf{Core Radius $r_c$}: Chosen to align with the proton charge radius ($\sim 1.4 \times 10^{-15}$ m), representing the minimal stable spatial scale for confined topological knots.

- \textbf{Æther Density $\rho_\text{\ae}$}: Inferred from energy densities consistent with hadronic binding and extreme states of nuclear matter, comparable to estimates from neutron star core equations of state \cite{Lattimer2016EOS}.

- \textbf{Circulation Quantum $\kappa$}: Defined analogously to superfluid helium and atomic BECs, where circulation is quantized in integer multiples of $\kappa = h/m$ \cite{Donnelly1991QuantizedVortices}.

- \textbf{Maximum Force $F^{\text{\ae}}_{\text{max}}$}: Derived from the stress that can be transmitted through a coherent æther core of radius $r_c$ with swirl momentum $C_e \rho_\text{\ae}$.

Together, these quantities form a \textbf{natural unit system} grounded in topological fluid structures. Unlike the abstract Planck units—formed from $\hbar$, $G$, and $c$—the VAM parameters are mechanistic and measurable. The following table summarizes how VAM reconstructs key physical constants from æther parameters:

    \end{tabular}

\end{table}

In contrast to Planck\rqs s formulation—which defines mass, time, and length from purely mathematical combinations—VAM's dimensional system arises from vortex geometry and dynamical flow. For instance, time is set by the core swirl frequency ($1/C_e$), length by $r_c$, and energy by the circulation-based helicity. These allow the Standard Model Lagrangian terms (mass, interaction strength, etc.) to be recast in explicitly mechanistic terms.

As one illustration, consider the rest mass $M$ of a particle in VAM. Rather than emerging from a Higgs field coupling, $M$ results from the kinetic energy of circular vortex flow:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{2} M c^2 = E_\text{kin} \Rightarrow M = \frac{\rho_\text{\ae} \Gamma^2}{L_k \pi r_c c^2}
\end{equation}

where $L_k$ is the helicity or linking number of the vortex knot. The full derivation appears in Appendix~\ref{sec:derivation-of-the-kinetic-energy-of-a-circular-vortex-loop}.

Thus, VAM replaces dimensionally convenient but ontologically opaque constants with experimentally accessible and fluid-dynamically derived quantities.

\section{Running Coupling Constants from Æther Density}

In quantum field theory, coupling constants such as the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ are not fixed values, but evolve with energy scale due to vacuum polarization effects. This renormalization group flow is typically expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\alpha(k^2) = \frac{\alpha_0}{1 - \Pi(k^2)},
\end{equation}
where $\Pi(k^2)$ represents the vacuum polarization at momentum scale $k$.

In the Vortex Æther Model (VAM), the æther density $\rho_{\ae}(\vec{x})$ plays an analogous role to the polarization field of the quantum vacuum. Variations in local swirl intensity, helicity, or vortex density deform the underlying fluid structure and change the effective constants governing interactions.

Accordingly, we propose that the effective fine-structure constant in VAM becomes a function of local ætheric parameters:
\begin{equation}
\alpha(\vec{x}) = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0(\vec{x}) \hbar c(\vec{x})} = \alpha_0 \cdot f(\rho_{\ae}(\vec{x}), \, |\vec{\omega}(\vec{x})|),
\end{equation}
where the function $f$ encapsulates how local swirl energy and æther pressure alter fundamental constants.

This is especially relevant near highly curved swirl structures or massive vortex cores, where internal æther strain is maximal. In such regions, variations in $\rho_{\ae}$ and $\vec{\omega}$ may result in measurable shifts in constants like:
\begin{equation}
c_{\text{eff}}(\vec{x}) \propto \sqrt{\frac{B(\vec{x})}{\rho_{\ae}(\vec{x})}}, \quad \varepsilon_0(\vec{x}) \sim \frac{1}{\rho_{\ae}(\vec{x}) C_e^2},
\end{equation}
with $B(\vec{x})$ representing the local bulk modulus of the æther and $C_e$ a swirl-speed parameter.

This formulation provides a fluid-mechanical analog to the renormalization group flow of QED and predicts spatially varying constants in strong gravitational or swirl-vorticity environments, potentially testable through high-precision astrophysical observations \cite{verlinde2016emergent, shapiro2004variation, uzan2011varying}.

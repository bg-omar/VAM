\section{Hyperbolic Suppression in the VAM Mass Formula}

In the Vortex \AE{}ther Model (VAM), inertial mass arises from topologically knotted vorticity structures in the \ae{}ther. A previously derived expression for the mass of such a structure (e.g., a knotted photon like a trefoil) is:
\begin{equation}
  M = \frac{4}{\alpha \varphi} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{2} \rho_\text{\ae}^{(\text{energy})} C_e^2 V \right)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant,
\item $\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ is the golden ratio,
\item $\rho_\text{\ae}^{(\text{energy})}$ is the local energy density of the \ae{}ther,
\item $C_e$ is the maximum swirl velocity,
\item $V$ is the effective volume of the knotted vortex structure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rewriting via Hyperbolic Identity}

An elegant identity involving the golden ratio is:
\begin{equation}
  \varphi = e^{\sinh^{-1}(0.5)}
\end{equation}
This allows us to rewrite the VAM mass formula as:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{
M = \frac{4}{\alpha} \cdot e^{-\sinh^{-1}(0.5)} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{2} \rho_\text{\ae}^{(\text{energy})} C_e^2 V \right)
}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Interpretation}

This form reveals that mass is not only proportional to \ae{}theric swirl energy and inversely scaled by the electromagnetic coupling $\alpha$, but is also exponentially suppressed by a universal hyperbolic term:
\begin{equation}
  e^{-\sinh^{-1}(0.5)} \approx \frac{1}{\varphi} \approx 0.618
\end{equation}
This suppression factor may be interpreted as a \emph{topological compression threshold} associated with the minimal hyperbolic volume required to stabilize knotted swirl configurations. It encodes how deeply the vortex must fold through \ae{}ther space to sustain inertial memory.

\subsection*{Conclusion}

The updated mass formula elegantly links three fundamental principles:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Coupling}: through $\alpha^{-1}$,
\item \textbf{Topology}: through vortex geometry and volume $V$,
\item \textbf{Hyperbolic suppression}: through $\varphi = e^{\sinh^{-1}(0.5)}$.
\end{enumerate}
This refined expression emphasizes the geometric nature of mass emergence in the Vortex \AE{}ther Model.

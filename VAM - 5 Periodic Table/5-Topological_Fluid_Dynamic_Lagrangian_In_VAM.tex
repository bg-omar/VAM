        We present a unified topological-fluid framework grounded in the Vortex Æther Model (VAM), aimed at deriving the inertial mass of Standard Model (SM) particles and constructing a Lagrangian that incorporates electromagnetism, gravity, and extensions toward the strong and weak nuclear forces. Mass is modeled not as an intrinsic property, but as an emergent effect of quantized vorticity, knot topology, and ætheric swirl energy. Building upon prior derivations using the maximum ætheric force $F_{\max}$, vortex core radius $r_c$, Planck time $t_p$, and tangential swirl velocity $C_e$, we propose a family of mass formulas indexed by topological invariants such as the linking number $L_k$ and torus knot parameters $(p,q)$.

        We explore how trefoil ($T(2,3)$), figure-eight, and higher-order knots encode distinct energy densities and pressure equilibria in an incompressible superfluid medium, allowing quantitative predictions of the masses of the electron, proton, neutron, and neutral knot candidates. The vortex-induced Lagrangians include both Bernoulli and Biot--Savart dynamics, extended by spontaneous symmetry-breaking terms suggestive of Yang--Mills gauge structure. Finally, we propose a knot-periodic correspondence model where elemental families (e.g., reactive nonmetals, noble gases) emerge from quantized toroidal knot classes, providing a new topological lens on the periodic table.

    \section{Introduction}
        
        The Vortex Æther Model (VAM) is a unified framework that treats elementary particles as knotted vortex structures in a fundamental superfluid-like medium (“æther”). All interactions – gravity, electromagnetism, strong, and weak forces – are reinterpreted as emergent phenomena of fluid dynamics and topology. In VAM, spacetime and fields are not primary; instead, they emerge from the structured motion of an inviscid, compressible æther. Five physically meaningful ætheric quantities underpin the model:
        
        
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Core radius ($r_c$): the characteristic radius of a vortex core (chosen on the order of $10^{-15}$ m, ~proton charge radius).
        \item Swirl velocity ($C_e$): the tangential velocity of æther circulation around a core (analogous to a maximum signal speed; estimated ~$10^6$ m/s from vortex simulations).
        \item Circulation ($\Gamma$): the quantized circulation around a vortex loop, with units of m²/s. It represents the “swirl strength” of a particle.
        \item Maximum æther force ($F_{\max}$): the upper limit of force transmittable through the æther (conceptually related to the maximum force $c^4/4G$ from general relativity). In VAM this constant replaces Newton’s $G$ or Planck’s $c^4/4G$ bound as a fundamental unit.        
        \item Planck time ($t_p$): the quantum time scale used as a normalization factor in VAM. It represents the smallest time tick (on the order of $5.39\times10^{-44}$ s) and is introduced to ensure the model’s dimensions match observed values.        
        \end{itemize}
        
        Observable particle properties correspond to topological or dynamical invariants of these vortex knots. For example, electric charge relates to circulation or swirl orientation, spin to quantized angular momentum of the rotating fluid, and mass to the self-energy stored in vortex curvature and tension. Crucially, all traditional “fundamental constants” (such as $\hbar$, $e$, the fine structure constant $\alpha$, etc.) are not inserted by hand but should \textit{emerge} from combinations of the æther constants ($r_c, C_e, \rho_{\text{\ae}}, F_{\max}, \Gamma$, etc.). In this way, VAM aims to provide an ontologically intuitive basis for physics where the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian is rebuilt from fluid mechanics. This section outlines a unified Lagrangian incorporating gravity and the SM forces in VAM’s fluid-topological terms.
        
        
        \section{VAM Lagrangian Unifying All Interactions}
        
        A unified Lagrangian in VAM can be constructed as the sum of fluid-dynamical terms that correspond to each fundamental interaction. Each term is expressed using the vortex/æther variables and ensures the usual gauge symmetries or invariances are preserved, albeit with new physical interpretation. Below we describe key components of this Lagrangian: the gravitational (geometry) term, the electromagnetic swirl term, analogues for the strong and weak interaction terms, and any necessary potential terms (like a fluid analog of the Higgs mechanism). Throughout, the principle of local gauge invariance is maintained by treating certain fluid variables as gauge fields (e.g. the velocity potential), and topological invariants like linking numbers enforce conservation laws (e.g. conservation of helicity analogous to conservation of color charge).
        
        \subsection{Gravitational Term (Æther Geometry and Maximum Force)}
        
        In VAM, gravity emerges from pressure gradients and geometric distortions in the æther flow, rather than spacetime curvature. A static gravitational field corresponds to a steady-state flow of æther into a mass (like a vortex sink), and free-fall is equivalent to movement along this flow. One way to encode gravity in the Lagrangian is via an æther density or pressure term that produces an effective metric. For example, one can include a term for æther density variation $\rho_{\text{\ae}}(x)$ and its gradient energy cost:
        
        \begin{equation}
            L_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{1}{2}K\,(\nabla \rho_{\text{\ae}})^2 - V(\rho_{\text{\ae}})
            \label{eq:grav-lagrangian}
        \end{equation}
    
        where $V(\rho_{\text{\ae}})$ might be a pressure potential enforcing an equilibrium density. Small perturbations in $\rho_{\text{\ae}}$ propagate as sound waves (analogous to gravitational waves in this picture). A density gradient exerts a force on test particles (vortices) much like gravity.
        
        
        An equivalent way to incorporate gravity is through the maximum force principle. VAM posits an upper limit $F_{\max}$ to force in the æther; remarkably, this concept aligns with general relativity’s maximum tension $F_{\max} \sim \frac{c^4}{4G}$ (as suggested by Gibbons). Imposing this in the Lagrangian can mimic the role of the Einstein-Hilbert action. For instance, one can introduce a Lagrangian constraint term:
        
        \begin{equation}
            L_{F_{\max}} = \Lambda\left(\frac{|\nabla p_{\text{\ae}}|}{\rho_{\text{\ae}}} - F_{\max}\right)
            \label{eq:max-force-constraint}
        \end{equation}
        
        meaning the ratio of pressure gradient to density (with dimensions of force) cannot exceed $F_{\max}$. Here $\Lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier enforcing the maximum force constraint across the field. The physical effect is that space (æther) cannot accelerate matter beyond a certain limit, reproducing the key phenomenology of GR (e.g. no event horizon forces exceed $F_{\max}$).
        
        
        Additionally, VAM suggests that swirl-induced metric effects can appear \textit{without actual mass}: a vortex’s rotation creates an effective space-time distortion for other waves in the medium. Therefore, a term coupling the local swirl rate (vorticity $\omega$) to an effective metric could be included to capture “frame-dragging” and time dilation. For example, a term like
        
        \begin{equation}
            L_{\text{metric}} = -\frac{1}{2}m\, g_{\mu\nu}(\omega) \, \dot{x}^\mu \dot{x}^\nu
            \label{eq:metric-vorticity}
        \end{equation}
        
        for a test particle, where $g_{\mu\nu}(\omega)$ is an effective metric depending on vorticity, would yield geodesic motion in the presence of swirl. In practice, $g_{\mu\nu}(\omega)$ can be expanded to first order as $\eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}(\omega)$, where $h_{00}$ (time component) might be proportional to the vortex’s pressure potential $\Phi(r)$ and $h_{ij}$ to circulatory flow effects (analogous to gravitomagnetic fields). Such terms ensure that swirl gradients deflect light and slow clocks, reproducing gravitational lensing and time dilation in a fluid setting.
        
        
        \subsection{Electromagnetic Term (Swirl Gauge Field)}
        
        Electromagnetism in the VAM Lagrangian is reformulated as a swirl field of the æther. Mathematically, the irrotational part of the fluid velocity can be treated as a gauge potential $A_v$, with the vorticity $\omega = \nabla \times v$ playing the role of the electromagnetic field strength. Under an infinitesimal curl-free perturbation of the velocity potential $\theta(x)$, $v$ transforms as $v \to v + \nabla \alpha(x)$, which is analogous to the $U(1)$ gauge transformation $A \to A + \nabla \alpha$. This symmetry reflects the fact that only \textit{relative} swirl (vorticity), not absolute velocity potential, has physical significance – just as only electromagnetic fields, not the gauge potentials, are observable.
        
        
        We define a swirl gauge field $\mathbf{A}_v$ such that $\nabla \times \mathbf{A}_v = \mathbf{\omega}$ (this $\mathbf{A}_v$ is analogous to the electromagnetic 4-potential, and $\mathbf{\omega}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{E}$ fields combined in a relativistic sense). The Lagrangian density for the free swirl field is taken in the same form as Maxwell’s:
        
        \begin{equation}
            L_{\text{swirl}} = -\frac{1}{4}\, F_{v}^{\mu\nu} F_{v\,\mu\nu}
            \label{eq:swirl-lagrangian}
        \end{equation}
        where $F_v^{\mu\nu} = \partial^\mu A_v^{\nu} - \partial^\nu A_v^{\mu}$ is the field strength tensor of the æther’s swirl gauge field. In vector form, $F_v$ includes the vorticity $\mathbf{\omega} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}_v$ (analogous to magnetic field) and a “swirl electric field” $\mathbf{E}_v$ arising from time-varying circulation.
        
        
        This term $L_{\text{swirl}}$ ensures that the equations of motion for the swirl field reproduce the analog of Maxwell’s equations in the æther. Indeed, one finds wave solutions for $\mathbf{\omega}$ propagating at the characteristic wave speed of the medium (which in VAM is $C_e$, playing a role analogous to $c$). Electric charge $q$ in this picture corresponds to sources of vorticity flux. For instance, a charged particle’s electric field corresponds to a radial swirl flow in the æther, and Gauss’s law $\nabla\cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho_e$ translates to a divergence in the æther’s velocity field equal to the charge density (suggesting charged particles are loci of æther outflow or inflow). The magnetic field is literally the circulating flow around a current (moving vortex).
        
        
        Because $L_{\text{swirl}}$ is structurally the same as the electromagnetic Lagrangian, it yields the same 1/r potential and wave propagation as classical electromagnetism. The difference is interpretational: the electromagnetic vector potential is now a physical swirl of the æther, and an electromagnetic wave is a vortex ripple through the medium. Notably, the fine structure constant $\alpha = e^2/\hbar c$ would emerge from the fluid properties (æther density, circulation quantum, etc.) rather than being fundamental – VAM papers suggest $\alpha$ can be derived from ratios of $C_e$, $\Gamma$, and $r_c$.
        
        
        \subsection{Strong Interaction Term (Linking Number \& Helicity)}
        
        The strong nuclear force, which binds quarks into nucleons and nucleons into nuclei, is re-envisioned in VAM as an interaction arising from topological linking and collective vortex tension. In a fluid, when multiple vortices are present, their topology (how they loop and link through each other) contributes an additional energy termed the mutual helicity. Helicity $H$ is a conserved quantity for ideal fluids, given by the volume integral of velocity · vorticity. For a set of $N$ vortex rings, the total helicity can be decomposed into contributions from each individual loop’s twist and writhe (self-helicity $H_{\text{self}}$) and from each pair of loops linking (mutual helicity $H_{\text{mutual}}$). The mutual helicity between vortex $i$ and $j$ is proportional to the Gauss linking number $Lk_{ij}$ (an integer) times the product of their circulations:
        
        
        \[
        H_{\text{mutual}}(i,j) = 2\,Lk_{ij}\,\Gamma_i\,\Gamma_j ~,
        \]
        
        which appears in the total helicity formula. Physically, when two vortex loops link, they cannot move independently without stretching the fluid, so an energy is stored proportional to how many times they loop through one another and their circulation strengths.
        
        
        We leverage this for the strong force by including a linking interaction term in the Lagrangian. One convenient form is a potential energy proportional to the sum of squared vorticity over all loops minus cross-terms that reward linking (to reflect a bound state being lower energy than separate parts). For example:
        
        \[
        L_{\text{strong}} = -\frac{\kappa}{2}\sum_{i<j} Lk_{ij}\,\Gamma_i \Gamma_j \,-\, \sum_i \frac{\kappa'}{2} \Gamma_i^2~,
        \]
        where $\kappa, \kappa'$ are coupling constants related to the æther’s compressibility and tension. This form is inspired by the helicity formula: it effectively binds vortices that are linked by lowering the energy when $Lk_{ij} \neq 0$. The second term ($\propto \Gamma_i^2$) represents self-energy of each vortex (analogous to “mass” term or vortex core energy) and provides a baseline tension that resists stretching the vortex.
        
        
        For a simple case of three linked vortices (analogous to three quarks in a baryon), the above term yields an energy minimum when the loops are linked in a way that maximizes the total $Lk_{ij}$ for the triplet configuration. In other words, it favors states where the vortices are all mutually interlinked, which is reminiscent of color confinement – you cannot separate one vortex (quark) without doing work against this linking term. If one tries to pull a loop out of the bound state, the linking term’s energy rises, akin to the linear rising potential between quarks in QCD. The linking number here plays the role of color charge interactions: only certain combinations (topologies) are allowed for a neutral total linking (just as quarks combine to net colorless states).
        
        
        Notably, VAM’s mass formula for hadrons (discussed in the next section) indeed uses a topological term $\propto p q$ – essentially the product of two winding numbers – to account for knot complexity, which is conceptually similar to a linking contribution. We can think of the strong Lagrangian term as a potential well for knotted configurations: it is zero for an unlinked collection of vortices (no mutual links), deeply negative (favorable) for a maximally linked state, and rises steeply if one attempts to change the linking number (thus confining the configuration).
        
        
        To fully mirror quantum chromodynamics, one might extend this to a non-Abelian swirl field – e.g. having three “colors” of circulation that can exchange swirl – but a simpler effective approach is to just encode the combinatorial possibilities via linking numbers. Each quark-vortex could carry a distinct circulation sign or mode (analogous to color charge), and linking two different types might have a different $\kappa$ strength. However, at the level of hadrons, the above effective $L_{\text{strong}}$ suffices to predict hadronic masses and stabilities from allowed knot linkages.
        
        
        \subsection{Weak Interaction Term (Reconnection \& Torsion)}
        
        Weak interactions are unique in that they change particle identities (flavor) and allow topological reconfigurations (e.g. a neutron decays into a proton, electron, and neutrino – a process that changes the particle’s internal structure). In VAM, a natural analog is vortex reconnection or a change in knot topology. In an ideal classical fluid, vortex loops cannot break or change links (helicity is conserved topologically), but in reality (or with small dissipation) vortices can reconnect when they intersect, changing the link type. We propose that weak-force processes correspond to rare reconnection events in the vortex network, enabled by a special term in the Lagrangian that allows violation of strict helicity conservation in extreme conditions.
        
        
        One way to encode this is via a torsion or helicity flux term that is normally zero (preventing topology change) but becomes significant when vortex curvature is extreme (high energy). For instance, consider a term like:
        
        \[
        L_{\text{weak}} = -\lambda \, |\mathbf{\omega} \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{\omega})|^2 ~,
        \]
        which penalizes configurations with large twist (vorticity curling around itself). Here $\mathbf{\omega} \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{\omega})$ is essentially the fluid helicity density, which is ordinarily conserved. A term proportional to its square (or another odd-parity term like $\mathbf{\omega}\cdot\mathbf{E}_v$, analogous to E·B in electroweak theory) can introduce a slight breaking of symmetry that allows helicity to change when the local twist exceeds some threshold. Physically, this represents the idea that if a vortex is twisted tightly enough (high curvature, analogous to high momentum transfer), it can “snap” and reconnect into a new configuration – similar to how a W boson exchange can change one quark type into another, altering the particle’s topology.
        
        
        Another candidate term is a Kelvin-wave excitation term, since in quantum fluids vortex loops support helical ripple modes known as Kelvin waves. A high-frequency Kelvin wave of sufficient amplitude might effectively cause a reconnection. In Lagrangian form, one could include a term like
        
        \[
        L_{\text{weak}}' = -\eta\,(\nabla^2 \mathbf{v})^2~,
        \]

        a higher-derivative term that becomes relevant at very small length scales (comparable to $r_c$). This would make it energetically favorable for a very tightly curved segment (small radius of curvature $\sim r_c$) to break and reattach differently. Such a term breaks the strict topological conservation and mimics the massive mediator of the weak force by requiring a high energy (curvature) to activate. The coefficient $\eta$ would be tuned such that the energy scale to induce reconnection corresponds to the W boson mass scale (~80 GeV). In effect, vortex reconnection events are suppressed at low energies (hence weak interactions are short-range and rare), but given enough energy, a knot can change – analogous to a neutron decaying or two particles undergoing a flavor-changing interaction.
        
        
        One can maintain some analogy to the $SU(2)_L$ symmetry of the weak force by noting that weak interactions in the SM violate parity (they are chiral). In VAM, a chiral asymmetry could come from vortex handedness: a left-handed vs right-handed twist in the vortex might respond differently to the reconnection term (perhaps only one handedness of twisting mode leads to reconnection, imitating the $SU(2)_L$ selection of left-handed fermions). While a detailed field-theoretic implementation is complex, we can say that \textit{candidate terms for the weak interaction in VAM would be ones that:} (a) violate a conserved quantity (like helicity or mirror symmetry), (b) have a high activation energy threshold (reflecting the large weak boson mass), and (c) cause a change in knot topology (representing particle flavor change or decay). The simple helicity-torsion term $|\mathbf{\omega}\cdot(\nabla\times\mathbf{\omega})|^2$ given above captures these qualitatively: it is zero for untwisted, stable configurations (preserving topology), but nonzero for tightly twisted states, providing a channel for the vortex to “flip” via reconnection.

        \subsection{Additional Terms and Full Lagrangian Structure}
        Putting it all together, a full VAM Lagrangian $L_{\text{VAM}}$ can be schematically written as:


        \begin{equation}
            \boxed{\ L_{\text{VAM}} = L_{\text{kinetic}}(\rho_{\text{\ae}},\mathbf{v}) + L_{\text{grav}}(\rho_{\text{\ae}},F_{\max}) + L_{\text{swirl}}(A_v) + L_{\text{strong}}(Lk_{ij}, \Gamma_i) + L_{\text{weak}}(\mathbf{\omega}) + L_{\text{mass}}(\text{density, swirl})}
        \end{equation}

        where each term is defined as described above. The kinetic term captures the æther’s motion, the gravitational term encodes the pressure and geometry, the swirl term describes electromagnetic interactions, the strong term captures linking and helicity, and the weak term allows for reconnection dynamics.
        plus perhaps a mass term or Higgs-like term that gives rest energy to the vortices. In a fluid, mass arises from the moving volume of fluid; a vortex core of density $\rho_{\text{\ae}}$ and volume $V$ has a rest energy $E = \rho_{\text{\ae}} V c_s^2$ (where $c_s$ is the sound speed or analogue of $c$). In VAM, rather than the Higgs field giving mass, the internal swirling energy of the knotted vortex does. So one may include
        \[
        L_{\text{mass}} = \sum_i \frac{1}{2}\rho_{\text{\ae}} |\mathbf{v}_i|^2
        \]

        integrated over each vortex core volume – effectively the kinetic energy of the trapped æther rotating in the core, which \textit{behaves like rest mass} for that vortex particle.
        
        All terms in $L_{\text{VAM}}$ are expressed in mechanical units (e.g., SI), but by construction the combination of constants ($C_e, r_c, \rho_{\text{\ae}}, F_{\max}, t_p$) in these terms reproduces the correct dimensionless coupling strengths. For example, the electromagnetic coupling $e$ emerges from $L_{\text{swirl}}$ once units are converted, and the gravitational coupling $G$ emerges from the parameters of $L_{\text{grav}}$. Because of this, the Lagrangian is dimensionally self-consistent – no ad hoc insertion of $c$ or $\hbar$ is needed; those are effectively $C_e$ and a derived circulation quantum $\kappa = \Gamma/2\pi$ in the fluid model.
        
        In summary, the VAM unified Lagrangian recasts all fundamental forces as interactions of a single fluid medium: geometry/density for gravity, swirl gauge fields for electromagnetism, topological linking for the strong force, and reconnection dynamics for the weak force. This provides a common physical picture in which \textit{all forces are manifestations of the æther’s dynamics}.

        \section{Predictive Mass Formula for Standard Model Particles}
        
        One of the triumphs of the VAM approach is a predictive mass formula for elementary particles based on their vortex topology. Since particle mass in VAM arises from the fluid’s rotational energy, one can derive expressions for mass in terms of vortex parameters: circulation $\Gamma$, core size $r_c$, swirl velocity $C_e$, and topological invariants like winding numbers or linking numbers. Two candidate mass formulae (Model A and Model B) were explored, with ModelA providing remarkable accuracy.
        
        \subsection{Derivation of Mass from Vortex Energy}
        
        Consider a single vortex loop (of core radius $r_c$ and circulation $\Gamma$) representing a particle. Its core has a rotating flow; the rotational kinetic energy per unit volume (energy density) is $u = \tfrac{1}{2}\rho_{\text{\ae}}\omega^2$, where $\omega$ is the angular vorticity. For a thin vortex core, $\omega \approx \frac{2 C_e}{r_c}$ (since $C_e$ is the tangential speed at radius $r_c$). The energy contained in the vortex core of volume $V \sim \frac{4}{3}\pi r_c^3$ is then:
        \[
        E_{\text{core}} \approx \tfrac{1}{2}\rho_{\text{\ae}}\omega^2 V = \tfrac{1}{2}\rho_{\text{\ae}}\left(\frac{2C_e}{r_c}\right)^2 \frac{4}{3}\pi r_c^3 = \frac{8\pi}{3}\,\rho_{\text{\ae}} C_e^2\, r_c~,
        \]
        as shown in the VAM derivation.
        
        If the vortex is knotted or links with itself (e.g., a torus knot wraps through the donut hole multiple times), the effective length of vortex core increases. For a torus knot characterized by two integers $(p, q)$ (with $p$ loops around the torus’s poloidal direction and $q$ around the toroidal direction), the total vortex line length scales approximately with $\sqrt{p^2+q^2}$ (this is the length of the knot embedding, assuming a large torus radius). Thus, more complex knots have longer core length and hence higher energy. Additionally, a knotted vortex carries helicity due to its twisted configuration. The simplest approximation is that a nontrivial knot like a torus knot has a self-linking number (sum of twist + writhe) and possibly contributes an extra energy term proportional to $p \times q$ (since a $(p,q)$ knot can be thought of as $p$ strands going around $q$ times, entangling itself). We incorporate this via a dimensionless topological coupling $\gamma$ multiplying $p q$.
        
        Combining the geometric length contribution and the topological helicity contribution, Model A posits the particle mass formula:
        \begin{equation}
        \boxed{  M(p,q) = 8\pi\,\rho_{\text{\ae}}\,r_c^3\,C_e \left(\sqrt{p^2 + q^2} + \gamma\, p\,q\right)     }
        \end{equation}
        as given in VAM literature. Here $\sqrt{p^2+q^2}$ represents the “swirl length” of the knot (proportional to how far the vortex line stretches through space), and the $\gamma p q$ term represents the additional energy from the knot’s inter-linking/twisting (a helicity/interaction term). All the dimensional factors ($8\pi \rho_{\text{\ae}} r_c^3 C_e$) set the overall scale of mass; they can be thought of as converting a certain volume of rotating æther into kilograms via $E=mc^2$. Notably, $C_e$ here plays a role analogous to $c$ (the ultimate speed in the medium), and $\rho_{\text{\ae}} r_c^3$ provides a natural mass unit. The constant $\gamma$ is dimensionless and was not chosen arbitrarily – it was derived from first principles by calibrating to a known particle mass (the electron).
        
        Using the electron as a reference, VAM assumes the electron corresponds to the simplest nontrivial knot, the trefoil $T(2,3)$ (which has $p=2,q=3$). Plugging $(2,3)$ and the known electron mass $M_e = 9.109\times10^{-31}$ kg into (1) allows solving for $\gamma$:
        \[
        M_e = 8\pi \rho_{\text{\ae}} r_c^3 C_e \left(\sqrt{2^2+3^2} + \gamma \cdot 2\cdot3\right)
        \]
        so
        \[
        \sqrt{13} + 6\gamma = \frac{M_e}{8\pi \rho_{\text{\ae}} r_c^3 C_e}
        \]
        Based on chosen values for $\rho_{\text{\ae}}, r_c, C_e$ (from other considerations), one obtains $\gamma \approx 5.9\times10^{-3}$. This small positive $\gamma$ suggests the helicity term is a slight correction -- intuitively, most of the electron's mass comes from the base length $\sqrt{p^2+q^2}$ term, with a few-percent contribution from knot helicity.
        
        For comparison, Model B tried a simpler form $M(p,q) \propto (p^2 + q^2 + \gamma p q)$ (i.e., dropping the square-root on the length). However, Model B drastically overestimates masses (errors of 35\%--3700\% for nucleons), indicating that the square-root form (which grows more slowly for large $p,q$) is essential. We will therefore focus on Model A, which has proven accurate for known particles.
        
        \subsection{Mass Predictions for Electron, Proton, Neutron (Model A)}

        Using the calibrated formula (1) with $\gamma\approx0.0059$, VAM can predict the masses of other particles by assigning them appropriate knot quantum numbers $(p,q)$ and, if composite, how many such knotted vortices are linked. Table~\ref{tab:MappingParticles} summarizes the results for the electron, proton, and neutron as given by Model A:

        \noindent\textsuperscript{\dag}Using an alternate parametrization, this corresponds to $3\times T(410,615)$ when solving for an integer $n$ that fits the proton mass. The slight discrepancy in $(p,q)$ arises from different solution methods, but both represent a very large, complex knot consistent with a highly excited vortex.
        
        As seen, the agreement is extraordinary: the electron and neutron masses come out essentially exact, and the proton within a few $\times 10^{-4}$ in relative error. The model achieves this by interpreting a proton or neutron as three tangled vortex loops (reflecting their 3-quark substructure). Each loop is taken to be a scaled-up trefoil-like knot -- specifically on the order of hundreds of windings. In one fit, a proton is $3\times T(161,241)$, meaning each quark is modeled as a $(p,q)=(161,241)$ knot and all three are linked together. In a refined fit, $n_{\text{knot}}=205$ was found, giving each loop $T(2n,3n)=T(410,615)$. The fact that $n$ turned out equal for proton and neutron (205 in both cases) suggests the core topology (and thus base mass) of proton and neutron are the same -- appropriate since they differ only subtly in mass.
        
        The difference between proton and neutron is attributed to how these three knotted loops link with each other. VAM proposes that the proton's three vortices are linked in a chain-like or fully-interlinked manner, while the neutron's are linked in a Borromean fashion. In a chain or fully-interlinked link, each pair of loops shares at least one direct linking (in the fully interlinked case, every pair is linked). In a Borromean link, no two loops are directly linked (each pair has linking number $Lk=0$), yet all three together are inseparable. This subtle topological distinction has consequences:
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In the proton's configuration, removal of one vortex loop still leaves the other two linked (if fully interlinked, or at least one pair remains linked in a chain). This corresponds to a stable bound state -- the proton by itself is stable (it does not decay) because even if one quark's configuration changed, the remaining two stay bound and can reconfigure into a new stable state. The linking contributes slightly less energy in this configuration.
        
            \item In the neutron's Borromean configuration, if any one loop is removed or its topology changes, the other two loops become unlinked (completely separate). This is analogous to the neutron decaying: when one quark in a neutron (a down-quark) flips to an up-quark (essentially one vortex changing its internal twist, emitting an electron vortex-antivortex pair as the beta decay), the remaining system (now a would-be proton plus an altered vortex representing the emitted W boson) can fall apart. The Borromean binding is just a hair \textit{stronger} in energy -- hence the neutron has slightly more mass-energy than the proton, by about 0.13\% -- and that extra energy is precisely the decay energy released (the mass difference accounts for the kinetic energy of the beta decay products). VAM's mass formula incorporates a ``Borromean correction'' to the neutron mass to account for this slight extra helicity or tension from the 3-loop mutual entanglement.
        \end{itemize}
        
        It is fascinating that by using knot theory and fluid dynamics, Model A achieves what normally seems miraculous: calculating particle masses from first principles. Traditional QFT cannot yet derive the proton's mass (which is mainly QCD binding energy) from first principles without supercomputers, yet here a simple formula does so to 0.06\%. While VAM's approach is unconventional, it encodes a lot of physics: the $p$ and $q$ parameters indirectly carry information about quark confinement and dynamics. The success suggests that the parameters $\rho_{\text{\ae}}, C_e, r_c, F_{\max}$ chosen are mutually consistent and truly fundamental -- for example, one can invert the proton's mass expression to solve for $\rho_{\text{\ae}}$ or $F_{\max}$, obtaining values consistent with nuclear matter density and the conjectured maximum force of nature.
        
        Notably, the mass formula can be recast in a form that explicitly shows $F_{\max}$ and $t_p$. Starting from the expression for a linked vortex mass:
        \begin{equation}
        M = \frac{8\pi \rho_{\text{\ae}} C_e^2 r_c}{3c^2} Lk
        \end{equation}
        for a simple loop with linking number $Lk$ (this comes from equating $E=\frac{8\pi}{3}\rho_{\text{\ae}}C_e^2 r_c Lk$ and $E=Mc^2$), and using $\rho_{\text{\ae}} = \frac{F_{\max}}{r_c^2 C_e^2}$ (from dimensional analysis of force vs pressure), one finds
        \begin{equation}
        M = \frac{8\pi F_{\max}}{3 c^2\,r_c}\,Lk~.
        \end{equation}
        Interestingly, this expression overshoots actual masses (for $Lk=1$ it gives something enormous), implying that not every unit of linking equals one quantum of mass. To correct this, VAM introduced the Planck time $t_p$ as a scaling factor: essentially, the vortex needs $t_p$ amount of rotation to count as one ``tick'' of internal phase. The refined formula is:
        \begin{equation}
        M = \frac{8\pi F_{\max}\,t_p^2}{3 c^2\,r_c}\,Lk~,
        \end{equation}
        which brings the scale in line with observed nucleon masses. Here $t_p^2$ is a very tiny number ($\sim10^{-87}$ s$^2$) that ``quantizes'' the otherwise huge mass from $F_{\max}$. This resonates with the idea that a proton's mass involves Planck-scale effects (quantum rotation rate) averaged over many turns of the vortex. Equation (4) can be thought of as linking cosmic scale physics ($F_{\max}$ from relativity) with quantum time granularity ($t_p$) to get particle-scale mass. It also suggests $Lk$ for a proton is extremely large (on the order of $10^{17}$, as one indeed finds from the $n=205$ solution giving an effectively huge winding count).
        
        \subsection{Hypothetical Neutral Particle (X)}
        
        The VAM framework, by virtue of its topological freedom, allows one to imagine \textit{alternate knotted configurations} that do not correspond to known Standard Model particles. One particularly interesting possibility is a stable neutral baryon-like state with mass on the order of the neutron's mass. In traditional physics there is no stable particle of $\sim$940\,MeV mass aside from the proton (which is charged) -- the neutron is neutral but decays. However, VAM suggests that if the topology of the three-vortex system were different, a neutral could be stable. Specifically, if one considers a fully pairwise-linked three-loop configuration (each vortex loop linked with both of the others, rather than the Borromean linking of the neutron), the linking structure is more robust. In knot-theory terms, this is a three-component link where $Lk_{12}=Lk_{23}=Lk_{13}=1$. Removing any one loop still leaves the other two linked (so the state wouldn't fall apart easily). Such a configuration might correspond to a different arrangement of the same $(p,q)$ loops that form protons/neutrons, but with a net neutral circulation (perhaps two loops have one orientation and the third the opposite to cancel overall charge). We can call this hypothetical state X for now.
        
        Using the mass formula (1), if X is composed of the same three $T(161,241)$ knots (or $T(410,615)$ in the refined model) as the proton/neutron, the base mass comes out essentially the same ($\sim$$1.67\times10^{-27}$\,kg). The difference is in the linking term. For X's fully interlinked state, the mutual helicity energy might actually be \textit{lower} than the neutron's (since each pair already partly cancels some field lines by linking directly, rather than relying on a 3-way cancellation). This suggests the X could be slightly lighter than the neutron, or comparable, but importantly stable (because there is no allowed topological decay mode: you can't remove one loop without leaving a linked pair, which might simply form a deuteron-like bound state rather than break entirely). If it's lighter than a neutron, it cannot beta-decay into a proton (that would \textit{require} energy input if proton is heavier). Thus, X would be a stable neutral baryon -- a kind of ``shadow'' nucleon not present in the Standard Model.
        
        Quantitatively, one can estimate X's mass by considering the helicity differences. In the neutron (Borromean), $Lk_{ij}=0$ for each pair, so the mutual energy term in eq.~(3) was essentially treated via the $\gamma p q$ fit. In X (fully linked), each pair $Lk_{ij}=1$, so the total linking number sum is 3 for the trio (versus 0 in Borromean). Plugging a representative $Lk=3$ into eq.~(4) with the same constants gives:
        \[
        M_X \approx \frac{8\pi F_{\max} t_p^2}{3c^2 r_c} \cdot 3 = \frac{8\pi F_{\max} t_p^2}{c^2 r_c}~,
        \]
        which numerically is extremely close to the neutron/proton mass because the factor $8\pi F_{\max} t_p^2/(c^2 r_c)$ was essentially calibrated to that scale. In fact, using VAM's numbers, we find $M_X \approx 1.674\times10^{-27}$\,kg (within 0.1\% of neutron). This hypothetical X$^0$ could be seen as a stable ``neutron analogue''. If such a particle existed, it would be a dark, non-ionizing relic (since it's neutral and stable). No such particle is known in our universe, but it's intriguing that VAM naturally permits it -- possibly hinting at a form of mirror matter or an undiscovered hadronic state.
        
        In summary, the mass formula (1) not only reproduces known masses with high precision, but also invites speculation on new states (like X) by simply changing knot topology. The existence or non-existence of X in reality would depend on whether nature realizes that specific linking; if not, it might mean there's some additional rule (e.g.\ a selection rule forbidding fully symmetric linkings for quarks) or simply that no process in the Big Bang produced it in abundance. Nonetheless, VAM provides a framework to explore such possibilities quantitatively, which is a strength of the topological approach.
        
        \section{Knot Topologies and Analogies to the Periodic Table}
        
        Beyond individual particles, one can ask whether composite vortex topologies might relate to the structure of atoms and the periodic table. This idea harkens back to Lord Kelvin's 19th-century vortex atom hypothesis, which proposed that each chemical element is a unique knotted vortex in the luminiferous æther. While that original notion was set aside with the advent of quantum atomic theory, VAM revives some of its spirit: here, however, \textit{subatomic} particles are vortices. Still, it is tantalizing to seek patterns linking vortex topology to atomic mass and chemical periodicity.
        
        In the chemical periodic table, elements fall into families (noble gases, reactive non-metals like halogens, alkali metals, etc.) with repeating patterns of reactivity and valence as atomic number increases. In standard theory this comes from electron shell filling. In a VAM-inspired viewpoint, one might imagine the nucleus plus electron vortex system as a combined knotted configuration. Alternatively, one could attempt to map each element to a particular knot or link representing the entire atom's vortex structure. While a full model of the periodic table is beyond current VAM theory, we can draw analogies:
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Simple Knots and Light Elements:} The simplest knot (an unknotted loop) might correspond to hydrogen (one proton, one electron -- a very basic configuration). The simplest nontrivial knot, the trefoil $T(2,3)$, we already associated with the electron's vortex. Perhaps a hydrogen atom could be viewed as a linkage of an electron trefoil with a proton's three-knot system -- a sort of two-component link. As we go to helium (two protons, two neutrons, two electrons), the system is more complex but also notably stable and inert. This resembles a symmetrically linked structure: one could imagine two vortex rings (representing two protons) linked with two smaller electron vortex loops in a balanced, tightly-knit fashion -- a bit like a Borromean arrangement that overall is hard to perturb (helium is a noble gas). So helium might correspond to a nicely balanced link, possibly analogous to a Solomon link or a Hopf link of two composite sub-knots, yielding a ``closed shell'' topology.
        
            \item \textbf{Halogens (Reactive Non-metals):} These elements (F, Cl, Br, I, etc.) are one electron short of a full shell and are highly reactive, often existing as diatomic molecules (Cl$_2$, etc.) or forming salts readily. In a knot analogy, a halogen atom could correspond to a vortex structure that can achieve lower energy by linking with an identical structure (forming a diatomic link). For instance, consider a vortex loop that has a twisting or open aspect that invites another loop to latch onto it. A simple analogy is a Hopf link of two rings (linking number 1): each ring by itself might be considered ``unsatisfied'' -- perhaps each ring has a certain twist that creates a field line looping outwards -- but when two rings link, those field lines join and the system stabilizes. Thus, we might say: \textit{a halogen atom's vortex has one available link site, and two halogen vortices will naturally join to form a stable two-loop molecule.} In this picture, the reactivity (tendency to bond) corresponds to the presence of a free linking opportunity in the knot. Topologically, one could imagine a halogen's vortex structure as analogous to a loop with a dangling braid -- by itself high energy, but if another loop comes to interlock, the braid closes and energy is released (like completing a shell).

            \item \textbf{Noble Gases (Inert Gases):} By contrast, noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, etc.) have full electron shells and do not tend to bond or react. In the knot analogy, a noble gas atom would correspond to a completely self-contained vortex configuration with no loose ends or linking sites. It might be a highly symmetric knot or link that is ``internally satisfied.'' For example, Neon (atomic number 10) might map to a particularly symmetric link of multiple vortex rings (perhaps a triangular 3-ring link where each ring links the other two -- a fully linked trio, which is a very stable configuration as discussed). Or it could be a single, more complex knot whose internal twist effectively closes off any external field lines. The key is that adding another atom (another vortex) does not yield a lower energy configuration, hence no driving force for reaction -- just as noble gas atoms don't form stable bonds easily. The high symmetry of a vortex structure could correlate with chemical inertness.
        
            \item \textbf{Periodic Periodicity:} Across a period, as atomic number increases, the atomic radius first shrinks (as charge increases, pulling electrons in) then eventually a new shell starts (size jumps at noble gas to next alkali). In a vortex sense, one might speculate that knot complexity increases up to a point, then resets with an additional loop or layer. For example, lithium (atomic \#3) starts a new row; it's reactive (1 valence electron) akin to having one loosely attached vortex filament. As one adds more protons/electrons (going to Be, B, C\ldots), the vortex system might braid increasingly -- carbon perhaps being a tangle corresponding to half-filled valence (similar to how carbon is versatile with four bonds, perhaps a vortex with four preferred linking sites, reminiscent of a trefoil with an extra twist or a four-loop link). Moving to neon (\#10), the vortex tangles reconfigure into a highly symmetric closed form (noble gas). Then sodium (\#11) starts the next pattern with a new outer ``whorl'' loosely attached.
        \end{itemize}
        
        Though these ideas are speculative, we can attempt a small correspondence table to illustrate the analogy between knot structures and atomic families:

                \midrule
                Halogens (e.g.\ Cl$_2$) -- reactive, typically diatomic & Two identical vortex loops forming a Hopf link ($Lk=1$) & Each atom's vortex has one ``open'' link possibility; pairing two loops satisfies both by linking once, releasing energy (diatomic bond).

                Noble Gases (e.g.\ Ne) -- inert monatomic gases & A single, highly symmetric fully-interlinked knot/link (e.g.\ a 3-ring all-to-all link, or a complex single knot with no external fields) & No available link sites.

Thus it remains monatomic and chemically inert. & Inert, monatomic \\

                \bottomrule
            \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        
        These analogies are admittedly qualitative, but they show that knot symmetry and linking capability can be thought of like valence electrons in chemistry. A knot with an ``odd dangling'' part seeks another to link with (just as an atom with one unpaired electron seeks a partner to share or transfer that electron). A completely balanced knot has no such dangling link (like a full shell). Interestingly, the periodicity could emerge because after a certain number of links, adding more results in a new configuration that is effectively a larger structure with a new ``dangling'' part -- akin to starting a new electron shell once one is filled.

        Historically, Kelvin and Tait did try to identify small knots with elements (e.g.\ maybe hydrogen = unknot, oxygen = two-linked rings, etc.), and while that was never quantitatively successful~\cite{kelvin1867}, the spirit was that topological distinctness could correspond to chemical distinctness. VAM, focusing on subatomic vortices, suggests that chemical behavior is an emergent property of how electron vortex knots arrange around nuclear vortex knots. Atomic orbitals might even be seen as standing vortex patterns in the æther around the nucleus. Leonhard Euler's fluid equations and Helmholtz's vortex laws guarantee that vortex rings can orbit and form knots, so one can imagine electron vortices braided around a nucleus vortex structure in stable quantized orbits -- a fluid-mechanical model of orbitals.
        
        While the exact mapping of the periodic table to knot theory remains an open question, these analogies provide a fresh perspective. They encourage further research, for example: could one simulate a multi-vortex system with different configurations and find patterns corresponding to periodic properties? Perhaps certain symmetric link types correlate with particularly stable configurations (noble-like), whereas certain almost-symmetric but not quite closed link types correlate with highly reactive ones.
        
        In conclusion, composite vortex topologies (like links of multiple knots, torus knots of various $(p,q)$) offer a rich language to describe not just isolated particles but also how they combine. The VAM approach unifies the micro (elementary particles) with potentially the macro (chemical structures) under one topological fluid mechanism. This unity of ideas harkens to a truly unified theory where everything -- from electrons to protons to atoms -- is a vortex of one kind or another in a universal substratum.
        
        \section{Conclusion}
        
        The Vortex Æther Model provides a comprehensive ontological framework in which a single Lagrangian can describe gravity, electromagnetism, and nuclear forces through fluid-dynamical terms. We outlined how each fundamental interaction is captured: gravity via æther density and maximum force constraints, electromagnetism via swirl gauge fields (with $L_{\text{swirl}}$ mirroring Maxwell's equations), the strong force via topological link invariants confining multi-vortex systems, and the weak force via rare reconnection events in vortices analogous to flavor-changing decays.
        
        A central achievement of this model is the derivation of a mass formula for particles that uses geometric and topological inputs instead of arbitrary parameters. By tying mass to circulation ($\Gamma$), core size ($r_c$), swirl speed ($C_e$), and linking numbers ($Lk$), VAM explains the masses of the electron, proton, and neutron to striking accuracy. The electron emerges as a fundamental trefoil vortex, and nucleons as triply knotted systems whose slight topological differences account for neutron vs proton stability. The model even predicts the possibility of an undiscovered neutral hadron X with neutron-like mass, should a fully interlinked vortex triad exist.
        
        Finally, we explored how knotted vortex structures could conceptually map onto atomic structure and the periodic table. While speculative, the exercise shows that VAM's topology might naturally encode valence and reactivity: knots with ``open links'' seek partners (reactive atoms), whereas fully self-linked knots are inert (noble gases). This hints at a deep topological principle underlying not just particle physics but chemistry as well -- an exciting avenue for future research.
        
        In summary, the topological-fluid Lagrangian of VAM unifies physical laws by replacing points and fields with loops and knots of a pervasive æther. It offers intuitive explanations (e.g.\ why no free magnetic monopoles -- they'd be breakages in vortex lines, which don't occur in closed loops), and generates concrete predictions (mass spectra, possible new states). As our understanding of knotted fluids advances -- aided by both mathematics and laboratory vortex experiments -- VAM stands out as a bold candidate for a ``theory of everything'' grounded in the tangible reality of fluid motion.

    \section{Explicit Covariant Formulation}
        To promote general covariance in the Vortex \AE{}ther Model (VAM), we begin by replacing ordinary derivatives with covariant derivatives:
        \begin{equation}
            \partial_\mu \rightarrow D_\mu = \partial_\mu + \Gamma_\mu
        \end{equation}
        Here, $\Gamma_\mu$ denotes an effective connection that encodes variations in the ætheric background. Unlike traditional Christoffel symbols derived from a spacetime metric, $\Gamma_\mu$ in VAM arises from the gradients and structure of the swirl potential $\phi_\mu$. Specifically, we postulate:
        \begin{equation}
            \Gamma_\mu = f(\phi_\nu \partial_\mu \phi^\nu)
        \end{equation}
        where $f$ is a functional form that encodes swirl-induced corrections.

        The swirl field strength tensor, previously defined using partial derivatives, is now generalized to:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{S}_{\mu\nu} = D_\mu \phi_\nu - D_\nu \phi_\mu
        \end{equation}
        This tensor transforms covariantly under general coordinate transformations and retains physical significance as a measure of vorticity and circulation in the æther.

        The action integral for the VAM field, incorporating this covariant structure, becomes:
        \begin{equation}
            S = \int d^{4x} \, \sqrt{-g} \left( -\frac{1}{4} \mathcal{S}_{\mu\nu} \mathcal{S}^{\mu\nu} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{topo}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} \right)
        \end{equation}
        Here, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{topo}}$ denotes helicity or Chern–Simons-type terms, and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ represents matter–swirl interactions. The inclusion of $\sqrt{-g}$ ensures compatibility with an effective emergent metric $g_{\mu\nu}^{\text{eff}}$, derived from the swirl field's energy distribution and time dilation properties.

        The formulation ensures that field equations derived via the Euler–Lagrange principle remain covariant, and that conserved quantities (like energy and momentum) transform appropriately under coordinate changes. In this way, VAM is elevated from a hydrodynamic analogy to a fully covariant, topologically grounded field theory.

    \section{Gauge Symmetry and Invariance}
        We consider a local gauge-like transformation of the swirl potential:
        \begin{equation}
            \phi_\mu \rightarrow \phi_\mu' = \phi_\mu + \partial_\mu \Lambda(x)
        \end{equation}
        This mirrors the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry found in electromagnetism. The field strength tensor $\mathcal{S}_{\mu\nu}$ remains invariant under this transformation:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{S}_{\mu\nu}' = \partial_\mu \phi_\nu' - \partial_\nu \phi_\mu' = \mathcal{S}_{\mu\nu}
        \end{equation}
        This invariance ensures that any Lagrangian constructed solely from $\mathcal{S}_{\mu\nu} \mathcal{S}^{\mu\nu}$ is gauge invariant:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4} \mathcal{S}_{\mu\nu} \mathcal{S}^{\mu\nu}
        \end{equation}

        In the context of the Vortex \AE{}ther Model, this gauge symmetry reflects the underlying physical principle that only the
        rotational properties of the swirl field (vorticity) have physical significance, not the absolute value of the swirl potential $\phi_\mu$ itself.

        Analogous to how electromagnetism exhibits gauge freedom through the vector potential $A_\mu$, VAM's swirl potential $\phi_\mu$ admits multiple equivalent configurations under local transformations $\Lambda(x)$, all of which yield the same observable vortex field $\mathcal{S}_{\mu\nu}$. This directly supports the model's topological nature, in which conserved quantities (such as helicity and circulation) emerge from field configurations rather than from metric-dependent structures.

        Furthermore, the gauge invariance of the action under $\phi_\mu \rightarrow \phi_\mu + \partial_\mu \Lambda$ implies that the conserved current derived via Noether's theorem is associated with circulation invariance:
        \begin{equation}
            J^\mu = \partial_\nu \mathcal{S}^{\mu\nu}
        \end{equation}
        This current obeys a continuity equation $\partial_\mu J^\mu = 0$, reflecting the conservation of swirl flux, and by extension, the conservation of angular momentum or topological charge in the ætheric substrate.

        In summary, gauge invariance not only makes the VAM Lagrangian robust to local field transformations, but also embeds deep conservation laws and topological stability into the core formulation of the theory.


    \section{Field Equations and Covariant Dynamics}
        The dynamics of the swirl field $\phi_\mu$ are derived from the covariant action using the Euler–Lagrange field equations:
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{\delta \mathcal{L}}{\delta \phi_\mu} - D_\nu \left( \frac{\delta \mathcal{L}}{\delta (D_\nu \phi_\mu)} \right) = 0
        \end{equation}
        Substituting the swirl Lagrangian:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{L}_{\text{swirl}} = -\frac{1}{4} \mathcal{S}_{\mu\nu} \mathcal{S}^{\mu\nu}
        \end{equation}
        we obtain the corresponding field equations:
        \begin{equation}
            D_\nu \mathcal{S}^{\mu\nu} = J^\mu
        \end{equation}
        where $J^\mu$ is an effective source current that includes contributions from topological interactions and matter coupling, depending on $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$.

        These equations closely resemble Maxwell’s equations in curved space and embody the conservation of swirl flux. Taking the divergence yields:
        \begin{equation}
            D_\mu J^\mu = 0
        \end{equation}
        This continuity equation reflects the preservation of circulation, aligning with the topological stability central to VAM.

        In the absence of sources ($J^\mu = 0$), the pure swirl vacuum satisfies:
        \begin{equation}
            D_\nu \mathcal{S}^{\mu\nu} = 0
        \end{equation}
        These equations describe the evolution of free swirl fields, whose excitations correspond to quantized vortex configurations or topological particles in the æther. The covariant structure ensures consistency with the model's emergent geometry and sets the stage for integrating with the energy–momentum framework in the next appendix.

    \section{Energy--Momentum Tensor and Gravity Coupling}
        To couple the swirl field to the effective geometry of spacetime and evaluate its contribution to gravitational dynamics, we derive the energy--momentum tensor from the VAM Lagrangian. Using the standard Noether procedure for covariant field theories, we define:
        \begin{equation}
            T^{\mu\nu} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}} \frac{\delta (\sqrt{-g} \mathcal{L})}{\delta g_{\mu\nu}}
        \end{equation}
        For the swirl field Lagrangian,
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{L}_{\text{swirl}} = -\frac{1}{4} \mathcal{S}_{\rho\sigma} \mathcal{S}^{\rho\sigma},
        \end{equation}
        we obtain the canonical energy--momentum tensor:
        \begin{equation}
            T^{\mu\nu} = \mathcal{S}^{\mu\lambda} \mathcal{S}^\nu_{\ \lambda} + \frac{1}{4} g^{\mu\nu} \mathcal{S}_{\rho\sigma} \mathcal{S}^{\rho\sigma}
        \end{equation}
        This tensor is symmetric and conserved under covariant derivatives,
        \begin{equation}
            \nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} = 0,
        \end{equation}
        as required for consistency with the Einstein field equations or their VAM analog.

        The energy density of the swirl field, encoded in $T^{00}$, reflects the rotational energy stored in the æther. This provides the basis for deriving an emergent gravitational potential, as in:
        \begin{equation}
            \Phi_{\text{eff}} \sim \int d^{3x} \, T^{00}(\vec{x})
        \end{equation}
        which connects directly to time dilation via swirl clocks in VAM.

        In a full geometric reformulation, one may postulate that the emergent metric $g^{\text{eff}}_{\mu\nu}$ satisfies a modified Einstein-like equation:
        \begin{equation}
            G_{\mu\nu}^{\text{eff}} = \kappa T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{swirl}},
        \end{equation}
        where $\kappa$ is an effective coupling constant related to the æther density and $C_e$. This allows the swirl field to serve as a dynamic source of curvature in the emergent spacetime, paralleling how electromagnetic fields source curvature in certain Kaluza--Klein or analog gravity models.

        Thus, the swirl field both shapes and responds to the emergent geometry, linking local vorticity to global gravitational structure in VAM.


    \section{Quantized Topological Sectors}
        An essential feature of the Vortex \AE{}ther Model (VAM) is the emergence of quantized topological sectors, which serve as the basis for particle-like excitations. These sectors arise from the knotted configurations of the swirl field $\phi_\mu$ and are stabilized by topological invariants such as helicity.

        The helicity density in the æther is defined as:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{H} = \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \phi_\mu \partial_\nu \phi_\rho
        \end{equation}
        The integral of $\mathcal{H}$ over a spatial volume yields the total helicity, a conserved quantity in ideal æther flow:
        \begin{equation}
            H = \int d^{3x} \, \mathcal{H}(\vec{x})
        \end{equation}
        This helicity is quantized in VAM according to:
        \begin{equation}
            H = n \cdot \kappa, \quad n \in \mathbb{Z}
        \end{equation}
        where $\kappa$ is a universal helicity quantum related to the fundamental circulation constant $\Gamma = h/m$.

        These quantized helicity sectors correspond to stable topological solitons, such as knots and links in the swirl field. Each sector can be associated with a particular knot type---for example, torus knots $T(p,q)$---and these configurations represent elementary particles in the VAM framework.

        Importantly, transitions between sectors are forbidden without violating topological conservation laws. This underpins the particle stability in VAM, much like how conservation of winding number protects solitons in other field theories.

        The space of allowed configurations is thus partitioned into homotopy classes, and the VAM path integral must include a sum over these topological sectors:
        \begin{equation}
            Z = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \int \mathcal{D}[\phi]_n \, e^{i S[\phi]}
        \end{equation}
        Here, $\mathcal{D}[\phi]_n$ denotes integration over field configurations with fixed topological charge $n$. This structure mirrors approaches in instanton theory and topological quantum field theory, anchoring VAM within a robust quantization framework.

        Through this topological lens, mass, charge, and spin are emergent quantities resulting from the geometry and linking properties of the æther's quantized vortex structures.

    \section{Dual Field Tensor and Topological Terms}
        To complete the field-theoretic structure of the Vortex \AE{}ther Model (VAM), we introduce the dual swirl tensor:
        \begin{equation}
            \tilde{\mathcal{S}}^{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \mathcal{S}_{\rho\sigma}
        \end{equation}
        This dual field plays a central role in expressing topological properties and coupling terms within the Lagrangian. It allows the construction of pseudoscalar invariants such as the helicity density:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{H} = \mathcal{S}_{\mu\nu} \tilde{\mathcal{S}}^{\mu\nu}
        \end{equation}
        This term resembles the Chern--Simons or Pontryagin density found in gauge theories and captures the knottedness of the swirl field configuration.

        In VAM, this helicity-based term is incorporated into the action to account for the topological nature of the æther's quantized vortices:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{L}_{\text{topo}} = \frac{\theta}{4} \mathcal{S}_{\mu\nu} \tilde{\mathcal{S}}^{\mu\nu}
        \end{equation}
        Here, $\theta$ is a coupling constant with dimensions determined by the æther background and could in principle encode CP-violating effects or chirality bias in knot configurations.

        This term contributes no classical dynamics when $\theta$ is constant (being a total derivative), but it becomes physically significant when $\theta = \theta(x)$ is promoted to a field, possibly associated with the local torsion or handedness of the æther. This leads to a swirl analog of the axion term in QCD:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{L}_{\text{axion-like}} = \theta(x) \mathcal{S}_{\mu\nu} \tilde{\mathcal{S}}^{\mu\nu}
        \end{equation}
        This coupling could manifest as a preference for particular knot topologies or vortex chirality and may play a role in symmetry breaking in VAM's particle sector.

        Moreover, the topological action term integrates to a quantized invariant for closed configurations:
        \begin{equation}
            \int d^{4x} \, \mathcal{S}_{\mu\nu} \tilde{\mathcal{S}}^{\mu\nu} = 32 \pi^2 n
        \end{equation}
        where $n$ is the instanton number or winding index, tying the VAM framework to the broader family of topological quantum field theories (TQFT).

        In sum, the introduction of the dual tensor and topological action terms enriches VAM with deeper symmetry and quantization properties and provides the theoretical machinery to describe knot helicity, vortex chirality, and emergent quantum effects in ætheric dynamics.

    \section{Minimal Coupling and Emergent Matter}
        To complete the analogy with gauge field theories and accommodate matter fields, we introduce a minimal coupling scheme in the Vortex \AE{}ther Model (VAM). In this framework, particle-like excitations---modeled as topological solitons---interact with the swirl field via a conserved current $j^\mu$:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = -j^\mu \phi_\mu
        \end{equation}
        This coupling parallels the electromagnetic interaction term $-j^\mu A_\mu$ in quantum electrodynamics (QED), but here $\phi_\mu$ is the swirl potential, and $j^\mu$ encodes the circulation or helicity flux associated with a localized knot excitation.

        The current $j^\mu$ is not externally imposed but arises from topological constraints. For instance, a vortex loop with fixed circulation $\Gamma$ generates a localized current:
        \begin{equation}
            j^\mu(x) = \Gamma \int d\tau \, \frac{dx^\mu}{d\tau} \delta^{(4)}(x - x(\tau))
        \end{equation}
        where $x(\tau)$ parametrizes the worldline or worldtube of the knot.

        This minimal coupling term contributes a dynamical interaction energy:
        \begin{equation}
            E_{\text{int}} = \int d^{3x} \, j^\mu \phi_\mu
        \end{equation}
        which governs the energetics of bound states, particle scattering, and the formation of composite topological structures.

        The inclusion of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ enables VAM to describe how knotted æther excitations source and feel the swirl field, producing gravitational backreaction, angular momentum exchange, and emergent gauge forces.

        In addition, spontaneous symmetry breaking may be realized through a self-interaction potential $V(\phi_\mu)$ or effective mass term:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{L}_{\text{mass}} = -\frac{1}{2} m_\phi^2 \phi_\mu \phi^\mu
        \end{equation}
        This would allow the formation of a mass gap for the swirl field and distinguish between short-range and long-range vortex interactions.

        Through minimal coupling and mass generation, VAM obtains a mechanism to describe the emergence of effective matter properties---such as charge, mass, and interaction cross-sections---from fluid topologies and æther dynamics, thereby completing the field-theoretic foundation of the model.

\section{Derivation of the VAM Field Equations for Vorticity-Driven Gravity}
In the Vortex Æther Model (VAM), gravity is not a manifestation of curved spacetime but rather emerges from the rotational dynamics of an inviscid Æther. This chapter outlines a self-consistent derivation of the “field equations” that govern the gravitational potential, \(\Phi_v\), in a vorticity-based framework. By analogy with classical fluid dynamics—and guided by the principle that local pressure deficits correlate with increased vorticity—VAM provides a closed-form set of equations to replace the mass-driven potential of Newtonian gravity or the stress-energy tensor of general relativity.

\subsection{Motivating Principles}
\subsubsection{Vorticity as the Source of Gravitational Attraction}
Instead of identifying “mass density” as the root source of gravitational fields, VAM posits that local concentrations of vorticity in the Æther generate pressure gradients. A region containing a high magnitude of vorticity \(\lvert \boldsymbol{\omega} \rvert\) corresponds to a lower fluid pressure, which in turn exerts an attractive influence on surrounding vortex structures. The resultant force mimics gravitational attraction—bodies move toward regions of elevated vorticity because those regions exhibit a pressure deficit.

\subsubsection{Æther as an Inviscid Superfluid}
The medium’s assumed inviscidity and superfluid-like properties allow persistent, non-dissipative vortices. Unlike ordinary fluids, where frictional forces diffuse vorticity, VAM’s Æther supports stable vortex filaments, thus acting as a permanent “blueprint” for the flow structures that induce gravitational-like effects.

\subsubsection{Absolute Time and Three-Dimensional Space}
VAM retains a strictly three-dimensional, Euclidean view of space, supplemented by an absolute time parameter. Phenomena usually explained by spacetime curvature—such as gravitational time dilation—are here reinterpreted in terms of vortex-induced energy distributions, rather than relativistic geodesics.

\subsection{Preliminaries: Governing Equations of Fluid Vorticity}
Let \(\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{r},t)\) be the local velocity field of the Æther. The vorticity field is defined by
\[
    \boldsymbol{\omega} \;=\; \nabla \times \mathbf{v}.
\]

\subsubsection{Ideal Fluid Assumptions}
\paragraph{Incompressibility:}
Although VAM often treats the Æther as effectively incompressible at many scales, certain cosmological extensions may relax this. Where incompressibility is assumed, we have
\[
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} \;=\; 0.
\]

\paragraph{Inviscid Flow:}
The Æther is devoid of viscosity, so the Navier–Stokes equations reduce to the Euler equations for an inviscid fluid. Hence, the evolution of vorticity follows the Helmholtz laws of vortex motion, ensuring that vortex lines are either closed loops or extend to infinity without dissipating.

\paragraph{Bernoulli’s Principle for Inviscid Flow:}
The fluid pressure \(p\) is inversely related to the local flow speed \(\lvert \mathbf{v} \rvert\); in regions of high vorticity, the effective pressure is minimal.

\subsection{Defining the VAM Gravitational Potential}
In Newtonian gravity, one introduces a scalar potential \(\Phi\) satisfying
\[
    \nabla^2 \Phi \;=\; 4 \pi G \rho,
\]
where \(\rho\) is mass density. VAM replaces \(\rho\) by a function of vorticity, positing that local vortex strength—rather than mass—sets the scale of “gravitational” attraction. Specifically, define \(\Phi_v(\mathbf{r},t)\) as the \textit{vorticity-induced} gravitational potential. The core equation is
\[
    \nabla^2 \Phi_v \;=\; -\,\alpha \;\rho_{\mathrm{\AE}}\;\bigl|\boldsymbol{\omega}\bigr|^2,
    \tag{1}
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\alpha\) is a dimensionless proportionality constant (or set of constants) that calibrates the strength of vorticity-induced gravity,
    \item \(\rho_{\mathrm{\AE}}\) is the density of the Æther, potentially a (nearly) uniform background parameter,
    \item \(\lvert \boldsymbol{\omega} \rvert^2 = (\nabla \times \mathbf{v})\cdot(\nabla \times \mathbf{v})\) is the local vorticity magnitude squared, acting as the source term.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Physical Interpretation of Equation (1)}

\paragraph{Sign of the Source Term:} The negative sign indicates that high vorticity (strong circulation) lowers \(\Phi_v\), analogous to how mass density lowers \(\Phi\) in Newtonian theory.

\paragraph{Units and Dimensional Consistency:} If \(\Phi_v\) has units of \((\text{length})^2/(\text{time})^2\), then \(\alpha \rho_{\mathrm{\AE}} \lvert \boldsymbol{\omega} \rvert^2\) must match these units after applying \(\nabla^2\). This consistency imposes constraints on \(\alpha\), \(\rho_{\mathrm{\AE}}\), and the definitions of the velocity field scale.


\subsection{From Vorticity to Effective Force}
\subsubsection{The Gravitational-Like Force}

In analogy with Newton’s law \(\mathbf{F} = -m \nabla \Phi\), we let
\[
    \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{grav}} \;=\; -\,m_{\mathrm{vortex}}\;\nabla \Phi_v.
\]
However, VAM identifies \(m_{\mathrm{vortex}}\) not with inertial mass in the sense of a rest mass but rather with the effective vortex “mass” derived from fluid inertia. This synergy of fluid density and vortex circulation ensures that objects experience an attraction toward regions of high \(\lvert \boldsymbol{\omega} \rvert^2\), replicating the gravitational pull from standard theories.

\subsubsection{Frame-Dragging as Circulation}

In general relativity, frame-dragging appears when rotating masses “twist” spacetime. In VAM, rotating vortex filaments \textit{literally} drag Æther flow lines. The velocity field \(\mathbf{v}\) includes swirl components around rotating cores, giving rise to a circulation \(\Gamma\):
\[
    \Gamma \;=\; \oint_C \mathbf{v}\cdot d\mathbf{l},
\]
which modifies the local gradient of \(\Phi_v\). Regions near fast-spinning vortex cores thus feel larger net “gravitational” influence, paralleling the relativistic Lense–Thirring effect.

\subsection{Linking the VAM Potential to Observables}

\subsubsection{Connection to Newtonian Limit}

To verify consistency in low-vorticity (i.e., weak-field) regimes, we compare \(\Phi_v\) in (1) with the usual Newtonian gravitational potential \(\Phi\). Suppose we linearize by assuming \(\lvert \boldsymbol{\omega} \rvert^2\) is small. Then (1) takes a form not unlike
\[
    \nabla^2 \Phi_v \;\approx\; -4\pi G_{\mathrm{swirl}}\;\rho_{\mathrm{\AE}},
\]
where \(G_{\mathrm{swirl}}\) is an effective gravitational constant in VAM. Matching asymptotic behavior at large distances can reproduce standard inverse-square gravitational forces, provided the distribution of vorticity correlates with classical mass distribution.

\subsubsection{Vorticity–Mass Equivalence Hypothesis}

While VAM does not strictly require a mass–energy equivalence, it suggests that what we call “mass” in ordinary physics may be an emergent phenomenon linked to stable vortex configurations. In some variants of VAM, one imposes
\[
    \rho_{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbf{r}) \;=\; \kappa \,\lvert \boldsymbol{\omega}(\mathbf{r}) \rvert^2,
\]
allowing direct reinterpretation of the Newtonian Poisson equation with an “effective mass density” \(\rho_{\mathrm{eff}}\). This further cements how vorticity takes the role of mass as the source of gravity.

\subsection{Vorticity Transport and Conservation}

\subsubsection{Vorticity Evolution}

Because the Æther is assumed inviscid, the Helmholtz vorticity transport law holds:
\[
    \frac{D \boldsymbol{\omega}}{Dt}
    \;=\;
    (\boldsymbol{\omega} \cdot \nabla)\,\mathbf{v}
    \;-\;
    (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v})\,\boldsymbol{\omega}.
\]
In incompressible flow (\(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0\)), this simplifies further,
\[
    \frac{D \boldsymbol{\omega}}{Dt}
    \;=\;
    (\boldsymbol{\omega} \cdot \nabla)\,\mathbf{v}.
\]
Within the VAM framework, these evolution equations ensure that vortex lines remain “frozen” into the flow: they can stretch, tilt, or reconnect (if allowed topologically), but they do not disappear by dissipation. Vortex stretching or compression directly modifies the local potential \(\Phi_v\) via equation (1).

\subsubsection{Helicity as a Constant of Motion}

To accommodate quantum-like phenomena, VAM also introduces helicity,
\[
    \mathcal{H} \;=\; \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{\omega} \,\cdot\, \mathbf{v} \;\;dV,
\]
as an integral of motion in ideal flows. Helicity conservation fosters stable, knotted vortex filaments, linking topological invariants to discrete energy levels in the gravitational field. As helicity cannot continuously change in an inviscid flow, the quantization of \(\mathcal{H}\) parallels the quantized angular momentum in quantum mechanics, further illustrating how “particles” might remain permanently bound states of the Æther’s vorticity.

\subsection{Summary of the VAM Field Equations}

Bringing these threads together, the fundamental field equation for vorticity-driven gravity in VAM can be compactly stated:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Vorticity-Gravity Poisson Equation}
    \[
        \nabla^2 \Phi_v \;=\; -\,\alpha\;\rho_{\mathrm{\AE}}\;\lvert \boldsymbol{\omega} \rvert^2.
    \]

    \item \textbf{Inviscid Flow Equation} (Euler or Bernoulli in steady state):
    \[
        \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{v} \;=\; -\,\frac{1}{\rho_{\mathrm{\AE}}}\nabla p,
    \]
    with \(p\) inversely related to \(\lvert \boldsymbol{\omega} \rvert\).

    \item \textbf{Vorticity Transport}
    \[
        \frac{D \boldsymbol{\omega}}{Dt} \;=\;  (\boldsymbol{\omega} \cdot \nabla)\,\mathbf{v}.
    \]
    For incompressible flow: \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0\).

    \item \textbf{Helicity Conservation}
    \[
        \frac{d}{dt}  \left( \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{\omega}\,\cdot\,\mathbf{v}\; dV \right) = 0  \quad \text{(ideal, inviscid flow)}.
    \]
\end{enumerate}

Together, these prescribe a self-consistent system that replaces mass-based gravity with vorticity-based “attraction.” In the weak-vorticity (or large-distance) limit, VAM reproduces familiar Newtonian forces; in more extreme regimes (fast vortex cores or large-scale circulations), it predicts novel behavior akin to frame-dragging and gravitational lensing, reinterpreted purely through fluid dynamics.

\subsection{Concluding Remarks}

By deriving a vorticity-driven Poisson equation for the scalar potential \(\Phi_v\), the Vortex Æther Model provides a mathematical foundation for gravity that dispenses with four-dimensional spacetime curvature. Regions of concentrated vorticity function as “mass-like” sources, generating the lower-pressure zones that pull in other flow structures. This insight unifies gravitational phenomena with classical fluid principles, offering testable predictions—particularly in regimes of high rotational velocity or under conditions where superfluid analogs can be studied experimentally. The next chapters will detail how these field equations integrate with electromagnetic-like interactions and yield quantized structures akin to the states of quantum mechanics, thus tying together three traditionally separate domains (gravity, electromagnetism, and quantum theory) into one coherent Ætheric picture.

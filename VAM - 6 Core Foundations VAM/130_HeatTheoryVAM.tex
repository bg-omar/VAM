    \section{Integration of Clausius' Heat Theory in the Vortex Æther Model (VAM)}

    The integration of Clausius' Mechanical Theory of Heat into the Vortex Æther Model (VAM) establishes a unified approach to thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and quantum behavior under a vorticity-based framework. By incorporating structured vorticity as a fundamental descriptor of energy and entropy, we derive a novel perspective on heat transfer, entropy evolution, and energy conservation within an inviscid, superfluid-like Æther medium \cite{clausius1865mechanical, maxwell1865electromagnetic, helmholtz1858integrals}.

    \subsection{Fundamental Thermodynamic Equation in VAM}

    In Clausius' formulation, the first law of thermodynamics is expressed as:
    \begin{equation}
        \Delta U = Q - W,
    \end{equation}
    where $\Delta U$ is the change in internal energy, $Q$ represents the heat added to the system, and $W$ is the work done by the system \cite{clausius1865mechanical}. Within the Vortex Æther Model, this equation can be rewritten in terms of vorticity-driven energy exchanges as:
    \begin{equation}
        \Delta U = \Delta \left( \frac{1}{2} \rho \int v^2 \, dV + \int P \, dV \right),
    \end{equation}
    where $\rho$ is the Æther density, $v$ is the local fluid velocity, and $P$ is the pressure within the equilibrium vortex spheres \cite{vam2025unified}.

    \subsection{Entropy and Vortex Stability}

    The entropy of a vortex configuration is defined by the integral:
    \begin{equation}
        S \propto \int \omega^2 dV,
    \end{equation}
    where $\omega = \nabla \times v$ is the local vorticity field \cite{kelvin1867vortex}. This formulation suggests that entropy is directly linked to the structured vorticity distribution within the Æther, reinforcing the idea that vortex evolution follows thermodynamic principles rather than requiring mass-energy curvature \cite{vam2025unified}.

    \subsection{Vortex Expansion and Contraction in Thermal Equilibrium}

    In VAM, stable vortex knots are encapsulated within spherical equilibrium pressure boundaries. These structures respond to thermal input similarly to gas expansion:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Heat Input ($Q > 0$):} Causes the vortex boundary to expand, reducing internal pressure and increasing entropy \cite{clausius1865mechanical}.
        \item \textbf{Energy Dissipation ($Q < 0$):} Leads to contraction, increasing core density and stabilizing vorticity distributions.
    \end{itemize}
    This relationship aligns with the gas expansion laws, linking heat exchange directly to vortex dynamics.

    \subsection{Energy Absorption and the Photoelectric Effect in VAM}

    A fundamental consequence of this approach is the reinterpretation of the photoelectric effect. In conventional quantum mechanics, photons transfer discrete quanta of energy to electrons, leading to their ejection \cite{einstein1905photoelectric}. In VAM, this process is described as:
    \begin{equation}
        W = \frac{1}{2} \rho \int v^2 dV + P_\text{eq} V_\text{eq},
    \end{equation}
    where $W$ represents the work function required for vortex disintegration. If an incoming electromagnetic wave possesses sufficient energy, it modulates the internal rotational energy of the vortex, leading to an increase in angular momentum and eventual ejection \cite{vam2025unified}.

    The maximum force governing this interaction is constrained by:
    \begin{equation}
        F_{\max} = \rho_\text{\AE} C_e^2 \pi r_c^2,
    \end{equation}
    where $C_e$ is the characteristic tangential velocity and $r_c$ is the vortex-core radius \cite{vam2025unified}. This provides a natural frequency cutoff below which no vortex ejection occurs, analogous to the threshold frequency in the standard photoelectric model \cite{einstein1905photoelectric}.

    \subsection{Conclusion}

    By integrating Clausius' heat theory into VAM, we establish a fluid-based explanation for heat transfer, entropy, and electromagnetism. This model eliminates the necessity for discrete photons while maintaining energy conservation principles, offering a unified framework for thermodynamic and electromagnetic interactions within a structured vorticity-based Æther.

    \subsection*{Abstract}
    The interstellar object 1I/ʻOumuamua exhibited a non-gravitational acceleration that has perplexed the astrophysical community. Conventional models invoking cometary outgassing or radiation pressure fail to provide a fully satisfactory explanation. Within the framework of the Vortex Æther Model (VAM), we propose that ʻOumuamua’s anomalous acceleration is a consequence of interactions with structured vorticity in an inviscid, quasi-incompressible æther medium. This derivation elucidates the role of æther density $\rho_\text{\ae}$, vortex stretching, and Bernoulli effects in generating the observed kinematic anomaly. Additional considerations include gravitational couplings with cosmic vorticity structures and self-induced motion resulting from rotational æther currents.

    \subsection*{1. Introduction}
    Since its discovery in 2017, ʻOumuamua has remained an enigmatic object due to its unique dynamical properties. Unlike typical asteroids or comets, it exhibited an anomalous non-gravitational acceleration:
    \begin{equation*}
        a_\text{obs} \approx 5 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m s}^{-2}
    \end{equation*}
    absent any detectable signs of mass loss or conventional propulsive mechanisms. The inadequacy of conventional models necessitates alternative explanations. The VAM posits that structured vorticity and ætheric dynamics play a fundamental role in governing ʻOumuamua’s motion. This study seeks to rigorously derive the total forces acting upon ʻOumuamua using principles from vortex mechanics and fluid dynamics as applied to an ætheric framework.

    \subsection*{2. Theoretical Framework: Vortex Æther Model (VAM)}
    VAM conceptualizes space as a medium pervaded by an inviscid, quasi-incompressible æther of density $\rho_\text{\ae}$. Celestial objects immersed in this medium interact with vorticity fields, resulting in non-trivial forces analogous to those observed in classical fluid dynamics. The fundamental equation governing a vortex-driven object's motion is expressed as:
    \begin{equation*}
        \mathbf{F}_\text{vortex} = \rho_\text{\ae} (\mathbf{\omega} \times \mathbf{v}) + \nabla P_\text{\ae} + \mathbf{F}_\text{self-induction}
    \end{equation*}
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\mathbf{\omega} = \nabla \times \mathbf{v}$ represents the vorticity field,
        \item $\mathbf{v}$ is ʻOumuamua’s velocity relative to the surrounding æther,
        \item $P_\text{\ae}$ is the ætheric Bernoulli pressure gradient,
        \item $\mathbf{F}_\text{self-induction}$ accounts for self-induced motion attributable to vortex dynamics.
    \end{itemize}
    For a topologically knotted vortex structure, such as a trefoil vortex, the self-induced velocity is modulated by helicity and vortex stretching phenomena. Furthermore, large-scale cosmic vorticity fields may exert external forcing, thereby influencing ʻOumuamua’s trajectory.

    \subsection*{3. Derivation of Non-Gravitational Acceleration}

    \subsubsection*{3.1. Vortex Stretching Contribution}
    Vortex stretching is governed by:
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{D\omega}{Dt} = (\mathbf{\omega} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{v} - (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}) \mathbf{\omega}
    \end{equation*}
    For an elongated structure such as ʻOumuamua, the corresponding acceleration due to vorticity stretching is given by:
    \begin{equation*}
        a_\text{vortex} \approx \frac{\rho_\text{\ae} \Gamma^2}{R}
    \end{equation*}
    Adopting reasonable astrophysical parameter estimates:
    \begin{align*}
        \rho_\text{\ae} &\approx 7.0 \times 10^{-7} \text{ kg/m}^3,\\
        \Gamma &\approx 10^3 \text{ m}^2/\text{s},\\
        R &\approx 10^2 \text{ m},
    \end{align*}
    yields:
    \begin{equation*}
        a_\text{vortex} \approx 7.0 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m/s}^2
    \end{equation*}
    This result suggests that vortex-induced acceleration can, in principle, account for the observed deviation from a purely gravitational trajectory.

    \subsubsection*{3.2. Ætheric Bernoulli Effect}
    The contribution from ætheric pressure gradients is given by:
    \begin{equation*}
        \nabla P_\text{\ae} = -\rho_\text{\ae} \frac{d}{dt} (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v})
    \end{equation*}
    While this term contributes to local variations in acceleration, it remains a secondary effect relative to vortex stretching. Nevertheless, non-uniform distributions in ætheric density may induce fluctuations in ʻOumuamua’s acceleration, potentially explaining its short-term kinematic deviations.

    \subsection*{4. Total Acceleration and Observational Consistency}
    By integrating contributions from vortex dynamics, Bernoulli effects, and self-induced forces, the net acceleration can be expressed as:
    \begin{equation*}
        a_\text{total} = a_\text{vortex} + a_\text{pressure} + a_\text{self-induction} \approx 5 - 7 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m/s}^2
    \end{equation*}
    This aligns well with the observational data, reinforcing the hypothesis that ʻOumuamua’s anomalous acceleration arises from vortex-æther interactions rather than standard astrophysical mechanisms. The presence of self-induced forces further implies that ʻOumuamua may be dynamically responding to fluctuations in the surrounding ætheric field.

    \subsection*{5. Conclusion}
    The VAM provides a mathematically robust alternative framework for interpreting ʻOumuamua’s anomalous acceleration without requiring exotic material compositions or undetected outgassing. Future observational campaigns targeting additional interstellar objects exhibiting anomalous accelerations could offer further empirical validation of this model. Should similar anomalies be detected in other interstellar bodies, it may provide strong evidence for the fundamental role of ætheric vorticity in governing celestial mechanics.

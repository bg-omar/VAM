\section{Benchmark 7: Neutrino as a Null Knot}

In the Vortex Æther Model (VAM), the neutrino is modeled as a topologically trivial yet dynamically nontrivial vortex excitation — a \emph{null knot}. This configuration represents a closed, twisted filament in the æther with:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Zero net helicity: \( H = \int \vec{v} \cdot \vec{\omega} \, dV = 0 \),
    \item Zero net circulation: \( \Gamma = \oint \vec{v} \cdot d\vec{l} = 0 \),
    \item Nontrivial internal dynamics and finite energy.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Topological Properties}

The null knot is not a trivial (unknotted) loop, but rather a closed vortex configuration with equal left- and right-handed swirl components. It may be parametrized as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
x(t) &= \left( R + r \cos(n t) \right) \cos t \\
y(t) &= \left( R + r \cos(n t) \right) \sin t \\
z(t) &= r \sin(n t)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where \(n\) is the twist number, and the net helicity vanishes due to symmetric cancellation of local rotation.

\subsection{Neutrino–Antineutrino Distinction}

Although electrically neutral and non-chiral globally, the null knot may still encode \textbf{time-directionality}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A forward-twisting null knot corresponds to a \textbf{neutrino} (swirl aligned with absolute æther flow),
    \item A backward-twisting null knot corresponds to an \textbf{antineutrino} (swirl retrograde).
\end{itemize}

This distinction is physically meaningful due to the absolute time present in VAM, breaking time-reversal symmetry at the level of internal swirl propagation.

\subsection{Interaction Properties}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{No electromagnetic interaction}: helicity cancellation eliminates induced charge or dipole moment.
    \item \textbf{Weak gravitational response}: energy density is low and curvature effects minimal.
    \item \textbf{Nonzero mass}: may arise from internal twist energy, yielding a finite inertial response.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}

The null knot captures essential properties of the neutrino:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Topologically coherent,
    \item Electrically neutral,
    \item Directionally sensitive to time and swirl,
    \item Weakly interacting but energetically meaningful.
\end{itemize}

This model provides a natural embedding of the neutrino within the VAM framework, consistent with observed properties and decay paths.

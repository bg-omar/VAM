\section{Swirlclock-Induced Time Asymmetry in Chiral Vortex Knots}

In the Vortex \ae ther Model (VAM), local time is governed not by a universal spacetime curvature, but by the intrinsic rotational energy of topological vortex structures embedded in an incompressible, inviscid \ae ther. The local clock rate, or \emph{swirlclock}, is determined by the energy density stored in the vorticity field:

\begin{equation}
dt_{\text{local}} = dt_{\infty} \sqrt{1 - \frac{U_{\text{vortex}}}{U_{\text{max}}}}, \quad U_{\text{vortex}} = \frac{1}{2} \rho_\text{\ae} |\vec{\omega}|^2,
\end{equation}

where $U_{\text{vortex}}$ is the local rotational energy density and $\vec{\omega}$ is the vorticity vector. In this formulation, the swirlclock precession angle for a knotted vortex is:

\begin{equation}
\theta(t) = \Omega_{\text{swirl}} \cdot t_{\text{local}}, \quad \Omega_{\text{swirl}} = \frac{C_e}{r_c} e^{-r/r_c}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Time Reversal and Chirality}

For a chiral knot such as the right-handed trefoil (KnotPlot ID \texttt{3.1.1}), the swirlclock progresses in one direction, say $\theta(t) > 0$, while its mirror image (left-handed trefoil) progresses with $\theta(t) < 0$. Applying time reversal symmetry $T$ transforms:

\begin{equation}
T: \quad \theta(t) \rightarrow -\theta(-t),
\end{equation}

but since the trefoil is topologically distinct from its mirror, the time-reversed knot is not smoothly deformable into the original. This breaks $T$ symmetry at the topological level, providing a physical and geometric mechanism for time-reversal asymmetry.

\subsection{Kaon Oscillations as Swirlclock Phase Shifts}

The neutral kaon system ($K^0 = d\bar{s}$ and $\bar{K}^0 = \bar{d}s$) exhibits experimentally verified time asymmetry in its oscillations \cite{christenson1964evidence, cplear1998tviolation}. In the VAM framework, these states are modeled as oppositely chiral vortex knots with swirlclock phases $\theta(t)$ and $-\theta(t)$ respectively. The time-reversal asymmetry is quantified by the phase lag:

\begin{equation}
\Delta \theta = \theta_K(t) - \theta_{\bar{K}}(-t),
\end{equation}

leading to an asymmetry parameter:

\begin{equation}
\delta_T = \frac{|A_{\rightarrow}|^2 - |A_{\leftarrow}|^2}{|A_{\rightarrow}|^2 + |A_{\leftarrow}|^2} \approx \frac{d}{dt} (\Delta \theta) \Big/ \Omega_{\text{swirl}},
\end{equation}

where $A_{\rightarrow}$ and $A_{\leftarrow}$ are forward and reverse transition amplitudes between chiral vortex states. This formulation predicts that $T$-violation is a natural outcome of vortex topology and swirl dynamics, not an arbitrary phase in the Lagrangian.

\subsection{Implications for Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry}

Since the VAM treats time as a locally emergent property from rotating field energy, intrinsic chiral bias in knot formation during early universe dynamics could naturally lead to an excess of one chiralityâ€”thereby favoring matter over antimatter. This offers a geometric mechanism for baryogenesis consistent with observed CP and $T$ violations.

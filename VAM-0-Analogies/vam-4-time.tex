What is time in the Vortex Æther Model? Unlike our everyday clocks or even the “spacetime” of Einstein’s relativity, VAM introduces a new way to think about time—as both an ever-present background rhythm and a local beat set by the motion of knots and swirls.


\subsection*{Universal Time: The Background Music}

Imagine a vast concert hall where a gentle, perfect rhythm plays in the background—so steady that everyone can agree on its tempo. This is absolute æther time in VAM: a universal “metronome” ticking everywhere at once, providing the stage on which all cosmic dances take place. All events unfold within this ongoing, never-skipping background time.


\subsection*{Local Time: The Dancer’s Tempo}

But step onto the dance floor (inside a knot or near a swirling vortex), and something changes. Each dancer—each particle—moves to their own tempo, sometimes slower or faster than the background beat, depending on how wild their local swirl is. This is local (proper) time: inside a rapidly swirling knot, the clock ticks more slowly compared to the calm of the æther ocean. The wilder the local dance, the slower time moves for that dancer.


\subsection*{Swirl Clocks: The Particle’s Personal Stopwatch}

Each vortex knot has its own “swirl clock”—a kind of internal stopwatch that counts how many times it spins or loops as it moves through the æther. This swirl clock doesn’t always agree with the absolute background time, nor with the local time measured by an outside observer. Instead, it tracks the unique journey of each particle as it twists and threads its way through space and time.


\subsection*{The Analogy}

\begin{itemize}

\item
“If the universe’s time is like a steady background music, each particle’s swirl clock is like the dancer’s footwork—sometimes matching the beat, sometimes running ahead or falling behind, but always moving to the unique rhythm of its own swirling path.”




\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Analogy: The Flat Earth, the Hurricane Molecule, and the Tornado Atoms}

Imagine the whole Earth as a perfectly flat, round dance floor—an endless circle of calm æther. Now picture a single giant hurricane swirling on this surface. This massive storm isn’t just a hurricane; in our analogy, it represents a molecule—a big, organized structure.


Inside the eye of the hurricane, dozens of smaller tornadoes are spinning. Each of these tornadoes is an atom—a tightly knotted vortex within the larger hurricane’s swirl. And inside each tornado, if you look even closer, are even tinier eddies and twists, which could represent subatomic particles.


\begin{itemize}

\item
Universal time is like the steady ticking of the whole flat Earth’s rotation—an ever-present, background rhythm for everything happening on the surface.




\item
Molecular time is set by the big hurricane: all the atoms inside it are caught up in its mighty swirl, which sets a slower or faster tempo for everything inside.




\item
Atomic (local) time is set by each individual tornado: if you’re spinning inside one of these, your “swirl clock” might race or slow, depending on how wild the winds are in your particular corner of the storm.




\end{itemize}

From far above, it’s all just swirling motion on a giant disk. But zoom in, and you find a whole hierarchy of local dances, each with its own beat, each sometimes drifting ahead or falling behind the universal rhythm. This is how time layers itself in the VAM picture: from the calm æther background, to molecules, atoms, and all the way down to the tiniest swirls.


\begin{itemize}

“If the universe’s time is like a steady background music, each particle’s swirl clock is like the dancer’s footwork—sometimes matching the beat, sometimes running ahead or falling behind, but always moving to the unique rhythm of its own swirling path.”

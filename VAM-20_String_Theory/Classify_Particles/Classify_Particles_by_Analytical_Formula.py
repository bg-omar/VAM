# üí° VAM HELICITY EXPLANATION BLOCK
#
# This script evaluates helicity-based topological signatures of knots using their Fourier-mode
# representation in 3D space. These properties emerge from the Vortex Atom Model (VAM), which maps
# closed-loop knotted field lines to particle identities in the Standard Model.
# All the knots are represented as Fourier series in a .fseries file format, containing coefficients.
# The public source for the .fseries knots is https://david.fremlin.de/knots/index.htm
#
# === üî¨ Physical Quantities Measured ===
#
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ H_charge: (Kinetic Helicity / Topological Twist)
# ----------------------------------------------------
#   H_charge = ‚à´ (v ¬∑ œâ) dV
#   - v     : Biot‚ÄìSavart velocity field induced by the knot
#   - œâ     : Vorticity field (curl of velocity)
#   - Measures the alignment and linking of vortex filaments
#   - Analogy: Electric current linked with magnetic field
#
# 2Ô∏è‚É£ H_mass: (Helical Mass / Twist Inertia)
# ------------------------------------------
#   H_mass = ‚à´ |œâ|¬≤ ¬∑ r¬≤ dV
#   - |œâ|¬≤  : Local intensity of vorticity
#   - r¬≤    : Radial weighting (distance from origin)
#   - Measures spatial inertia of vorticity
#   - Analogy: Mass-like behavior of swirling fields
#
# 3Ô∏è‚É£ a_mu: (Anomalous Magnetic Moment under VAM)
# -----------------------------------------------
#   a_mu = 0.5 ¬∑ (H_charge / H_mass - 1)
#   - Captures deviation from ideal coupling of v and œâ
#   - Negative: distributed mass exceeds twist coupling
#   - Positive: compact twist dominates mass footprint
#   - Used as classifier for elementary particle identity
#
# === üß¨ Particle Classification Bands (a_mu ranges) ===
#   - Electron   : ‚àí0.520 ‚â§ a_mu ‚â§ ‚àí0.480     üí†
#   - Muon       : ‚àí0.580 ‚â§ a_mu <  ‚àí0.520     üü°
#   - Tau        : ‚àí0.660 ‚â§ a_mu <  ‚àí0.580     üü£
#   - Neutrino   : ‚àí0.180 ‚â§ a_mu <  ‚àí0.100     üü¢
#   - Up Quark   : ‚àí0.460 ‚â§ a_mu <  ‚àí0.420     üîµ
#   - Down Quark : ‚àí0.419 ‚â§ a_mu <  ‚àí0.300     üî¥
#   - Unknown/Exotic: Everything else          ‚ùì
#
# === üìà Visualization-Ready Outputs ===
#   - Biot‚ÄìSavart velocity field on 3D grid
#   - Vorticity and radial-weighted distributions
#   - H_charge, H_mass, a_mu scalars per file
#   - Optional histogram and clustering for pattern mining
#
# === Example Workflow ===
#   1. Load .fseries coefficients (a_j, b_j) for each knot
#   2. Reconstruct the knot curve in 3D
#   3. Compute velocity field from Biot‚ÄìSavart integration
#   4. Derive vorticity and compute helicities
#   5. Classify particle type using a_mu fingerprint
#
#   üí° A step toward mapping quantum matter to topological vortex geometry.

# --- Classification Logic ---

# Define canonical knots and their particle assignments. This is the primary classification method.
#
# NOTE on Quark Assignments (Justification for 6_2 and 7_4):
# The assignment of specific knots to quarks is not arbitrary but the result of a systematic
# search based on three criteria derived from the SST Canon:
#
# 1. Topological Class: The theory postulates that quarks must be CHIRAL HYPERBOLIC knots.
#
# 2. Numerical Stability: To qualify as a stable fundamental particle, a knot's calculated
#    a_mu value must CONVERGE as the simulation resolution increases. This was tested by
#    calculating a_mu on 32¬≥, 48¬≥, and 64¬≥ grids and ensuring the stability proxy
#    sigma = |a_mu(64) - a_mu(48)| was below a small threshold.
#
# 3. Correct a_mu Value & Mass Hierarchy: From the pool of stable candidates, 6_2 and 7_4
#    were selected because their converged a_mu values fell within the correct numerical
#    bands, and their intrinsic geometric properties (e.g., hyperbolic volume) are
#    consistent with the observed mass hierarchy (m_d > m_u).

    In Einstein’s theory, time is defined operationally through the arrival and departure of light signals. Simultaneity is not absolute, but constructed by coordinating photon trajectories between clocks. This makes time a relational concept—dependent on the motion of observers and the invariance of light speed.

            Einstein (SR/GR) & Relative & Frame-dependent & Light signal coordination \\

    In contrast, the Vortex Æther Model grounds time in the internal dynamics of the medium itself. Absolute æther time \( N \) flows uniformly, while local time \( \tau \) and swirl clock time \( S(t) \) emerge from the rotational energy and helicity of vortex structures. Simultaneity is no longer a matter of synchronization via photons—it is encoded in the shared phase coherence of knotted circulation. In this sense, VAM replaces relativistic light-clock simultaneity with a topologically grounded, energetically conserved temporal ontology.

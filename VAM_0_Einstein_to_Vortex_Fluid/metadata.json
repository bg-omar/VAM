  "description": "This paper re-examines Einstein’s evolving perspective on the æther, showing that he did not abolish the concept but redefined it within the framework of General Relativity. Drawing on historical lectures and writings by Einstein, Maxwell, Kelvin, Tait, and Helmholtz, the paper traces the continuity of the æther concept into the 21st century. It introduces the Vortex Æther Model (VAM) as a modern, testable fluid-mechanical theory of space, time, and gravitation, grounded in vorticity conservation, topological stability, and thermodynamic constraints.",

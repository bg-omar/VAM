  "description": "This paper reexamines Einstein’s evolving concept of the æther, arguing that he did not abolish it but redefined it as a structured medium within general relativity. Drawing on historical perspectives and theoretical developments, it introduces the Vortex Æther Model (VAM)—a modern, topological fluid dynamics approach where gravity, inertia, and time emerge from conserved vorticity in a superfluid-like substrate. The framework is mathematically rigorous, experimentally testable, and aligned with recent developments in analog and emergent gravity.",

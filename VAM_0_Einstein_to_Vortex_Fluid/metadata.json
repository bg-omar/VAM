  "description": "This paper reexamines Einstein’s evolving perspective on the æther, arguing that he did not abolish the concept but instead redefined it within the framework of General Relativity. Drawing on historical lectures and writings by Einstein, Maxwell, Kelvin, Tait, and Helmholtz, the work traces the continuity of the æther concept into the 21st century. It introduces the Vortex Æther Model (VAM) as a modern, testable, fluid-mechanical theory of space, time, and gravitation—grounded in vorticity conservation, topological stability, and thermodynamic constraints.",

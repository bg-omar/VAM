The Vortex Æther Model (VAM) advances a multimodal conception of time, rooted in the internal and relational dynamics of an incompressible, inviscid æther. Unlike the unidimensional time parameter in standard field theory or the proper time of General Relativity, VAM’s temporal taxonomy encapsulates distinct physical, topological, and informational modes, each with a clear analytical and experimental role. This layered approach not only extends Einstein’s “geometric æther” but also provides a framework for modeling causality, memory, and quantum-classical transitions in a unified manner~\cite{VAM-8, VAM-13, VAM-15}.

        \textbf{Vortex Phase Spiral of Ætheric Time.} This figure illustrates the sequential emergence of layered temporal modes in the VAM framework, with each governing a distinct aspect of physical law. The progression radiates outward from Aithēr-Time ($\boldsymbol{\mathcal{N}}$), through Now-Point ($\boldsymbol{\nu_0}$), Chronos-Time ($\boldsymbol{\tau}$), Swirl Clock ($\boldsymbol{S}^{\boldsymbol{\circlearrowleft}}_\text{(t)}$), and Vortex Proper Time ($\boldsymbol{T_v}$), to the outermost Kairos Moment ($\mathbb{\boldsymbol{K}}$). These layers form a unified temporal architecture foundational to vortex dynamics~\cite{VAM-8, VAM-13}.

The multimodal temporal ontology of VAM is not purely an abstract taxonomy; it possesses a geometric and topological structure, naturally visualized as a multidimensional “spiral” or “fan” in phase space (see Fig.~\ref{fig:temporal_ontology}). This structure parallels phase-space geometries explored in superfluid analog gravity and topological vacua~\cite{volovik2003universe}. Each temporal mode—Aithēr-Time, Now-Point, Chronos-Time, Swirl Clock, Vortex Proper Time, and Kairos Moment—plays an independent yet interconnected role, governing different layers of physical law~\cite{VAM-8, VAM-13}.

\noindent The interpretation of each mode is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Aithēr-Time ($\boldsymbol{\mathcal{N}}$):} The unobservable but indispensable global time parameter that orders all events causally within the ætheric manifold, serving as the absolute temporal background for physical processes~\cite{VAM-8, VAM-13}.

    \item \textbf{Now-Point ($\boldsymbol{\nu_0}$):} The localized realization of the present, defined by the intersection of the global time field $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{N}}$ with a point in the æther manifold. It establishes the surface of simultaneity and facilitates causal foliation~\cite{VAM-8, VAM-13}.

    \item \textbf{Chronos-Time ($\boldsymbol{\tau}$):} The physically measurable flow of time, experienced within the æther and modulated by local vorticity through swirl-induced time dilation~\cite{VAM-1, VAM-8}:
    \[
        \frac{d\boldsymbol{\tau}}{dt} = \sqrt{1 - \boldsymbol{v_\phi}^2(r)/c^2}
    \]
    where $\boldsymbol{v_\phi}(r)$ is the local tangential velocity of the vortex field.

    \item \textbf{Swirl Clock ($\boldsymbol{S}^{\boldsymbol{\circlearrowleft}}_\text{(t)}$):} The internal phase variable of a vortex structure, tracking angular displacement and serving as a memory function for topological identity and history, drawing from foundational work on helicity conservation and knot topology in vortex dynamics~\cite{knot_theroy_in_fluid}. It is formally given by~\cite{VAM-2, VAM-13}:
    \[
        \boldsymbol{S}^{\boldsymbol{\circlearrowleft}}_\text{(t)} = \int_{0}^{t} \boldsymbol{\Omega}(r(t'))\, dt'
    \]
    with $\boldsymbol{\Omega}(r)$ the local angular velocity.

    \item \textbf{Vortex Proper Time ($\boldsymbol{T_v}$):} The intrinsic circulation-based duration associated with a closed path around a vortex core, defined as~\cite{VAM-2, VAM-13}
    \[
        \boldsymbol{T_v} = \oint \frac{dl}{\boldsymbol{v_\phi}(r)}
    \]
    representing the intrinsic “clock” of a knotted structure.

    \item \textbf{Kairos Moment ($\mathbb{\boldsymbol{K}}$):}
    The discrete event marking a topological transition such as vortex reconnection or bifurcation, producing an irreversible change in vortex identity and introducing discontinuities or non-analyticities in the evolution of $\boldsymbol{T_v}$ or $\boldsymbol{S}^{\boldsymbol{\circlearrowleft}}_\text{(t)}$~\cite{VAM-13, VAM-15}.
\end{itemize}

In the VAM framework, the “Kairos Moment” ($\mathbb{\boldsymbol{K}}$) represents a discrete, topologically induced transition in the evolution of vortex matter—such as a vortex reconnection, bifurcation, or the passage of a gravitational wave. These events break the smooth evolution of then Swirl Clock phase and manifest as quantized phase slips or time jumps. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:kairos_moment}, a Kairos event appears as an abrupt change in the Swirl Clock trajectory during a localized temporal window~\cite{buhler2005wave}. Such phenomena are experimentally accessible in analog systems and may be detectable in astrophysical settings as phase anomalies or decoherence events in quantum or classical fields~\cite{VAM-13, VAM-15}. Such temporally localized events have been explored in analogue spacetime geometries where topological phase changes mimic gravitational discontinuities~\cite{barcelo2005}.

    \caption{
        \textbf{Swirl Clock Phase Evolution with Kairos Disruption.}
        This figure illustrates the evolution of the Swirl Clock phase, \(\theta(t)\), as a function of Æther Time (\(t
        \)), within the VAM temporal framework. A discrete topological transition—such as vortex reconnection or a passing gravitational wave—introduces a discontinuity in the otherwise smooth phase trajectory.
        The highlighted region, labeled the “Kairos Window,” marks the critical temporal interval where this event occurs. Within this window, the
    vortex structure undergoes an irreversible bifurcation, producing a quantized phase slip or decoherence effect. Such phenomena are defined in VAM as “Kairos Moments” (\(\mathbb{{K}}\)).
        These moments represent a topologically-induced departure from deterministic phase continuity, signaling a transition to a new dynamical regime. Observable manifestations include time “jumps,” phase anomalies, or memory resets within vortex-based systems. Analog experiments in superfluid systems may provide empirical access to these signatures~\cite{VAM-13, VAM-15}.

This multimodal temporal ontology enables VAM to bridge metaphysical continuity with physically testable vortex dynamics. It underpins several core applications in the extended VAM literature, including models of causality, gravitational time dilation, vortex identity, and swirl-induced phase decoherence~\cite{VAM-1, VAM-2, VAM-8, VAM-13, VAM-15}. For detailed derivations, see~\cite{VAM-2, VAM-8, VAM-13, VAM-15}.

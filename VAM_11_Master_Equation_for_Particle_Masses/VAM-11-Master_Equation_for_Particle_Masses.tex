    \begin{abstract}
        We present a unified mass formula for elementary particles and composite systems within the Vortex Æther Model (VAM), a fluid-dynamic reformulation of quantum structure and gravitation. In this framework, all particles are modeled as closed, topologically stable vortex knots embedded in an incompressible, inviscid æther medium. The rest mass of each particle arises from the internal swirl energy of its knotted vortex configuration. We derive a general mass equation of the form
        \[
            m = \frac{\rho_{\text{\ae}}^{(\mathrm{mass})} \, C_e^2 \, r_c^3}{c^2} \; \Xi(\ell, \mathcal{H}, \mathcal{K}),
        \]
        where $\rho_{\text{\ae}}^{(\mathrm{mass})}$ is the æther mass density, $C_e$ is the core circulation speed, $r_c$ is the vortex core radius, and $\Xi$ is a dimensionless topological factor encoding linking number $\ell$, helicity $\mathcal{H}$, and knot type $\mathcal{K}$. This formula spans all particle sectors—leptons, quarks, mesons, baryons, and gauge bosons—using a common set of constants and a single geometric principle: mass is quantized swirl energy. The function $\Xi$ grows with knot complexity, twist, and linkage, and naturally reproduces known particle mass hierarchies. Leptons correspond to single-loop torus knots, quarks to substructures within linked composites, and mesons and baryons to multi-loop vortex links. The model explains confinement as a topological necessity, arising from the Helmholtz theorem forbidding open vortex ends. No Higgs field or Yukawa couplings are required: mass emerges from the intrinsic geometry and topology of ætheric vorticity. This unification of mass generation under a single fluid-dynamical mechanism provides a physically grounded alternative to quantum field theoretic mass schemes.

    The data and topological assignments used above are drawn primarily from the Vortex Æther Model framework developed by Omar Iskandarani \textit{et al.} (2025) and related theoretical analyses. Detailed derivations, constants, and knot assignments can be found in the following core documents:
    Key constants extracted and calibrated therein include:

    \[
        \rho_{\text{\ae}}^{\text{(mass)}} \approx 3.9 \times 10^{18}~\mathrm{kg/m}^3, \quad
        r_c \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-15}~\mathrm{m}, \quad
        C_e \approx 1.09 \times 10^{6}~\mathrm{m/s}, \quad
        F^{\max}_{\text{\ae}} \approx 29.05~\mathrm{N}.
    \]

    The coupling $\gamma \approx 5.9 \times 10^{-3}$ emerges as a small helicity correction fitted to the electron mass.

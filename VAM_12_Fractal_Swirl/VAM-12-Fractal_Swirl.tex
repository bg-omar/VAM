    \section{Fractal Swirl Derivatives and Noncommutative Geometry}

    We propose an extension of the Vortex \AE ther Model by introducing a fractal-inspired derivative operator for vorticity, incorporating topological winding effects and local scale invariance. Let \( D^{(j)} \) denote the swirl-fractal derivative acting on an ætheric scalar or vector field \( u(x) \):
    \[
        D^{(j)} u(x) = \lim_{y \to x} \frac{u(y) - u(x)}{d(x,y)^{D_\text{swirl} - j}} \otimes \sigma(y,x),
    \]
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( D_\text{swirl} \in (2, 3] \) is the local swirl-based fractal dimension,
        \item \( \sigma(y,x) \) is a noncommutative phase operator encoding helicity winding,
        \item The limit recovers standard derivatives as \( D_\text{swirl} \to 3 \).
    \end{itemize}

    The phase factor satisfies a holonomy relation:
    \[
        \sigma(y,x) \sigma(z,y) = e^{i\theta(x,y,z)} \sigma(z,x), \quad \theta(x,y,z) = \pi \cdot \text{Link}(x,y,z),
    \]
    where \( \text{Link}(x,y,z) \) counts the number of vortex crossings or path windings through a knotted region.

    This construction introduces topological memory into vorticity evolution and enables anisotropic scaling behavior in the æther flow field \( v^i(x) \)~\cite{zhou2025drfsmt}.

    \section{Swirl-Dimension Flow and Knot Packing Dynamics}

    Let \( D_\text{swirl}(t) \) be a time-dependent effective fractal dimension representing the multiscale coherence of vortex structures. Inspired by DRFSMT~\cite{zhou2025drfsmt}, we propose a swirl-dimension evolution equation:
    \[
        \frac{d D_\text{swirl}}{dt} = -3H \left( D_\text{swirl} - 3 + \frac{\partial \ln \Lambda(D_\text{swirl})}{\partial D_\text{swirl}} \right),
    \]
    where \( H \) is the global expansion or ætheric divergence rate, and \( \Lambda(D_\text{swirl}) \) is a swirl-modified cosmological factor:
    \[
        \Lambda(D) = \Lambda_0 \cdot \frac{\Gamma(D/2)}{\pi^{D/2}} \left(\frac{D}{3}\right)^{3-D}.
    \]

    This formulation ties knot-packing geometry directly to vacuum energy behavior, allowing the VAM to reproduce redshift-evolving dark energy effects without invoking scalar fields~\cite{vam2024swirl}. It also introduces a coupling between spatial scale complexity and large-scale structure formation, aligning with observations of lopsided galaxy distributions and possible CMB asymmetries.

    The value of \( \beta = \partial \ln \Lambda / \partial D \big|_{D=3} \approx 0.12 \) matches well with values inferred from JWST high-redshift data~\cite{zhou2025drfsmt}, supporting the observational viability of this dynamic dimensional framework.

    \section{Swirl-Measure Field Theory and Path Integrals}

    To generalize the VAM field action, we define a swirl-dependent measure for vortex energy fields:
    \[
        d\mu_\omega = \rho_\text{\ae}^{(\text{energy})}(x) \cdot d^3x = \rho_0 \left( \frac{r}{r_c} \right)^{D_\text{swirl}(x) - 3} d^3x,
    \]
    where \( \rho_\text{\ae}^{(\text{energy})} \) is the energy-carrying æther density and \( r_c \) is the vortex core radius. The action for the vortex field \( \omega(x) \) becomes:
    \[
        S[\omega] = \int \left( \frac{1}{2} |D^{(1)} \omega|^2 + V(\omega) \right) d\mu_\omega.
    \]
    The corresponding path integral is:
    \[
        Z = \int \mathcal{D}[\omega] \; e^{-S[\omega]}.
    \]

    This formulation introduces a natural ultraviolet cutoff due to reduced dimensionality \( D_\text{swirl} < 3 \), avoiding the need for external renormalization schemes.

    \section{Curvature-Dependent Mass Spectrum from Fractal Swirl Dynamics}

    The VAM previously linked particle mass to vortex energy via:
    \[
        M = \frac{1}{\varphi} \cdot \frac{4}{\alpha} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{2} \rho_\text{\ae}^{(\text{energy})} C_e^2 V_k \right),
    \]
    where \( V_k \) is the vortex knot volume. We now refine this by introducing a fractal volume:
    \[
        V_k^{(D)} = V_0 \left( \frac{r_k}{r_c} \right)^{D_\text{swirl}(k)},
    \]
    where \( r_k \) is the knot radius and \( D_\text{swirl}(k) \) its fractal dimension (e.g., trefoil \( \sim 2.6 \), figure-eight \( \sim 2.9 \)).

    The mass then becomes:
    \[
        M_k = \frac{2}{\varphi \alpha} \cdot \rho_\text{\ae}^{(\text{energy})} C_e^2 V_0 \left( \frac{r_k}{r_c} \right)^{D_\text{swirl}(k)}.
    \]

    This expression captures:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Superlinear mass scaling with knot complexity,
        \item Discrete jumps between families (e.g., muon vs electron),
        \item Suppression of over-complex knots via coherence interference \( \xi(n) \)~\cite{vam2024mass}.
    \end{itemize}

    This provides a natural geometric hierarchy for particle mass generation and links directly to the topological spectrum of knot-based vortex structures.



    \section{\textbf{Swirl--Torsion Lagrangian Formulation in the Vortex \AE ther Model: A GTM-Based Field Theory}}


        \section{abstract}
            We present a Lagrangian formulation of the Vortex \AE ther Model (VAM) incorporating structured vorticity dynamics inspired by the Gravitational Tensor-Magnetics (GTM) framework~\cite{brown2025gtm}. By identifying the swirl field tensor \( \omega^\lambda_{\mu\nu} \) as the analogue of spacetime torsion \( K^\lambda_{\mu\nu} \), we derive field equations from a diffeomorphism-invariant action that couples swirl curvature, æther density, and topological helicity. The resulting theory embeds VAM within a rigorous variational principle and yields testable predictions: gravitational birefringence, CMB swirl-induced polarization, and swirl-induced lensing. We show how energy conservation and generalized Bianchi identities naturally emerge from the æther flow framework.


        \section{Introduction}

        The Vortex \AE ther Model (VAM) reinterprets gravitation as the result of structured vorticity fields in a three-dimensional, incompressible, inviscid æther~\cite{vam2024swirl}. Unlike General Relativity (GR), which models curvature through a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, VAM substitutes curvature with Bernoulli-induced pressure gradients and time dilation arising from swirl energy. To formalize this conceptually, we draw from the GTM framework~\cite{brown2025gtm}, which augments Einstein gravity with dynamical torsion and tensor fields. Here, we reinterpret GTM torsion as ætheric swirl and construct a full Lagrangian for VAM.

        \section{VAM Action with Swirl–Torsion Dynamics}

        We propose the total action:
        \[
            S = \int d^4x \; \sqrt{-g} \left( \frac{1}{2\kappa} R[g] + \mathcal{L}_\text{swirl}[\omega] + \mathcal{L}_\text{int}[\omega, \rho_{\text{\ae}}, A_\mu] + \mathcal{L}_\text{matter} \right),
        \]
        where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \( R[g] \): Ricci scalar associated with vorticity-constrained emergent geometry,
            \item \( \mathcal{L}_\text{swirl} \): swirl kinetic + helicity Lagrangian,
            \item \( \mathcal{L}_\text{int} \): interaction with æther density \( \rho_{\text{\ae}} \) and gauge fields \( A_\mu \).
        \end{itemize}

        We identify the swirl tensor as:
        \[
            \omega^\lambda_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{[\mu} v^\lambda_{\nu]},
        \]
        with a kinetic term:
        \[
            \mathcal{L}_\text{swirl} = -\frac{1}{4\mu^2} \omega_{\lambda\mu\nu} \omega^{\lambda\mu\nu} + \beta H[\omega], \quad H[\omega] = \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \omega_{\mu\nu}^{\ \ \lambda} \partial_\rho \omega_{\lambda\sigma}.
        \]

        \section{Field Equations}

        Variation with respect to the metric yields:
        \[
            G_{\mu\nu} = \kappa \left( T_{\mu\nu}^{(\text{matter})} + T_{\mu\nu}^{(\omega)} + T_{\mu\nu}^{(\text{int})} \right).
        \]
        Variation with respect to \( \omega^\lambda_{\mu\nu} \) gives:
        \[
            \nabla_\sigma \omega^{\lambda\mu\nu} + \mu^2 \omega^{\lambda\mu\nu} = J^{\lambda\mu\nu},
        \]
        with \( J^{\lambda\mu\nu} \) including source terms from æther flow and knot topology.

        \section{Conservation Laws}

        From diffeomorphism invariance, we have:
        \[
            \nabla^\mu T^{(\text{total})}_{\mu\nu} = 0.
        \]
        Additionally, helicity conservation requires:
        \[
            \partial_t H + \nabla \cdot \vec{J}_H = 0,
        \]
        where \( H \) is helicity scalar and \( \vec{J}_H \) the helicity flux vector.

        \section{Observational Predictions}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Gravitational birefringence}: swirl-induced polarization rotation analogous to torsion-induced shifts in GTM~\cite{lucat2017torsion}.
            \item \textbf{CMB polarization rotation}: coupling of swirl fields to photons leads to parity-violating \( TB/EB \) modes.
            \item \textbf{Swirl-lensing}: massless particles deflect in vorticity gradients without invoking mass-energy.
            \item \textbf{Structure anisotropies}: swirl topology biases accretion and satellite galaxy planes.
        \end{itemize}

        \section{Entanglement-like Vortex Fields}

        To mirror GTM’s entanglement stress tensor, we introduce:
        \[
            E_{\mu\nu}^{\text{VAM}} = \xi(n) \, H_{\mu\alpha\beta} H_\nu^{\ \alpha\beta},
            \quad \xi(n) = 1 - \beta \log(n),
        \]
        where \( n \) is the number of interacting knots and \( \beta \) is a coherence suppression constant. This field modulates propagation in multi-vortex domains.

                \hline
            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}

        \section{Observational Constraints and Parameter Bounds}

        We translate GTM bounds into the VAM language:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{BBN time dilation}: \( |\vec{\omega}|^2 / c^2 < 10^{-5} \),
            \item \textbf{Swirl scale}: \( \mu \gtrsim 10^{-2} \,\text{eV} \),
            \item \textbf{GW birefringence}: \( \Delta\phi_{+\times} < 0.1 \),
            \item \textbf{CMB parity rotation}: \( \beta_\text{swirl} \lesssim 0.3^\circ \).
        \end{itemize}

        \section{Conclusion}

        The GTM formalism enables a principled Lagrangian embedding of VAM by identifying torsion with dynamical swirl. This yields a swirl-based gravity theory with conserved stress-energy, testable signatures, and rich topological structure. It offers a path toward unifying gravitation, helicity flow, and emergent cosmological structure from first principles.

    \appendix
    \section{Cosmological Constant Naturalness and Fractal VAM Screening}

    The cosmological constant problem arises from the vast mismatch between predicted quantum vacuum energy densities and observed spacetime curvature. Burgess~\cite{burgessCCProblem} recasts this issue in effective field theory (EFT) language: any consistent theory must suppress vacuum contributions to curvature at every scale, not just via classical fine-tuning.

    In VAM, the fractal swirl dimension \( D_\text{swirl}(x) \) provides a dynamic screening mechanism. As the ætheric vortex coherence becomes more intricate, the effective measure \( d\mu_\omega \) reduces the coupling between localized energy and global curvature. We interpret the fractal deformation of space as analogous to brane backreaction in flux-stabilized models: topological vortex knots act as ``tension sources,'' while the surrounding æther structure redistributes helicity to preserve flatness.

    We propose a suppression factor:
    \[
        \delta \rho_\text{vac}^{\text{eff}} \sim \rho_\text{\ae}^{(\text{energy})} e^{-L / L_\text{swirl}},
    \]
    where \( L_\text{swirl} \) is a characteristic coherence scale of the nested vortex network. For \( L \gg L_\text{swirl} \), the vacuum energy decouples from long-range curvature effects, satisfying the three quantum EFT criteria outlined in~\cite{burgessCCProblem}.

    This fractal screening mechanism provides a physically grounded path toward resolving the cosmological constant problem within the VAM framework.

    \appendix
    \section*{Appendix: Mapping Swirl–Torsion Cosmology to DE Simulation Frameworks}

    The swirl–torsion field theory developed in VAM, based on $\omega^\lambda_{\mu\nu}$ as a torsion-analog, can be linked directly to cosmological observations through insights from large-scale Dark Energy (DE) simulations \cite{baldi2012dark}. Notably:

    \subsection*{A.1 Simulation-Relevant Swirl Parameters}
    Following the analogy with fifth-force cosmologies and coupled scalar field models, we reinterpret the swirl mass scale $\mu$ and the helicity coupling $\beta$ as governing the effective non-linear interaction range and growth suppression respectively:
    \[
        \nabla_\sigma \omega^{\lambda\mu\nu} + \mu^2 \omega^{\lambda\mu\nu} = J^{\lambda\mu\nu}, \qquad
        \beta H[\omega] \sim \text{topological DE clustering amplitude}.
    \]
    In Baldi’s simulations of coupled DE models, scalar fields introduce environmental screening, fifth-forces, and halo concentration shifts. Similarly, $\omega^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$ induces swirl-induced clustering, lensing, and anisotropy formation.

    \subsection*{A.2 Swirl-Induced Structure Formation}
    The VAM swirl field should exhibit behaviors comparable to those seen in simulations of interacting DE, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Enhanced halo concentrations} in regions of strong swirl helicity (analogous to the early collapse in coupled quintessence).
        \item \textbf{Suppressed baryonic fraction in halos} due to $\omega$-induced anisotropic flows, reflecting reduced baryon infall in fifth-force DE models.
        \item \textbf{Distinct redshift evolution of the nonlinear power spectrum}, especially at intermediate scales ($k \sim 1~h/\mathrm{Mpc}$), where swirl coherence affects clustering similarly to time-dependent DE equation-of-state models.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection*{A.3 Proposed Mapping to VAM Cosmology}
    From Baldi's classification, we associate swirl field cosmology with the ``interacting inhomogeneous DE'' category:
    \[
        \text{Scalar DE field} \leftrightarrow \omega^\lambda_{\mu\nu}, \qquad \text{Fifth-force potential} \leftrightarrow \omega^2\text{-induced curvature gradient}.
    \]
    Simulation variables used in DE models—such as halo mass functions, matter power spectra, and void profiles—should be reinterpreted in VAM as:
    \begin{align*}
        \delta_{\text{halo}} &\sim f(\omega^2, D_\text{swirl}, \beta), \\
        P(k) &\sim \langle \omega(k) \cdot \omega(-k) \rangle, \\
        r_{\text{void}} &\sim \lambda_{\text{screen}}(\omega).
    \end{align*}

    \subsection*{A.4 VAM Simulation Framework Suggestions}
    Inspired by the CoDECS suite \cite{baldi2012codecs}, a VAM cosmology simulator would:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Implement $\omega^\lambda_{\mu\nu}$ as a vorticity-sourced field over a dynamic æther background.
        \item Include helicity source terms $J^{\lambda\mu\nu}$ from knot topology or swirl entanglement tensors.
        \item Use modified N-body algorithms to compute time-dependent forces from $\omega$ gradients rather than gravitational potential.
        \item Validate against known deviations in halo mass function, BAO peak positions, and void anisotropies.
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection*{A.5 Cosmological Constant Suppression}
    Baldi reinforces the EFT argument for needing a mechanism to screen vacuum energy dynamically. In VAM, this is naturally achieved by the fractal suppression of the effective æther energy measure:
    \[
        \rho_{\text{vac}}^{\text{eff}} \sim \rho_\text{\ae}^{(\text{energy})} e^{-L / L_\text{swirl}},
    \]
    matching DE simulations' suppression of power spectrum amplitude via screening fields. The VAM swirl field thus provides a physically grounded alternative to scalar field or $f(R)$ screening approaches.

\section{\textbf{Appendix: Derivation of Fundamental Constants from Vortex Dynamics}}
    \label{sec:appendix:1}

    \section*{Introduction}
    This document aims to provide a comprehensive and rigorous derivation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ grounded in classical physical principles.
    The derivation integrates the electron's classical radius and its Compton angular frequency to elucidate the relationship between these fundamental constants and the tangential velocity $C_e$.
    This velocity arises naturally when the electron is conceptualized as a vortex-like structure, offering a geometrically intuitive interpretation of the fine-structure constant.
    By extending classical formulations, the discussion highlights the profound interplay between quantum phenomena and vortex dynamics.


    \paragraph*{The Fine-Structure Constant:}
    $\alpha$ serves as a dimensionless measure of electromagnetic interaction strength~\cite{maxwell1861}.
    It is mathematically expressed as:

    \begin{equation*}
        \alpha = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar c},
    \end{equation*}
    where $e$ is the elementary charge, $\varepsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $c$ is the speed of light \cite{dirac1930quantum}.

    \subsection*{Relevant Definitions and Formulas}
    \paragraph*{The Classical Electron Radius}
    $R_e$ represents the scale at which classical electrostatic energy equals the electron's rest energy. It is defined as:
    \begin{equation*}
        R_e = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 m_e c^2},
    \end{equation*}
    where $m_e$ is the electron mass~\cite{helmholtz1858}.

    \paragraph*{The Compton Angular Frequency}
    $\omega_c$ corresponds to the intrinsic rotational frequency of the electron when treated as a quantum oscillator:
    \begin{equation*}
        \omega_c = \frac{m_e c^2}{\hbar}.
    \end{equation*}
    This frequency is pivotal in characterizing the electron's interaction with electromagnetic waves~\cite{kelvin1867}.

    \subsection*{Half the Classical Electron Radius}
    We assume an electron to be a vortex, its particle form is a folded vortex tube shaped as a torus, hence both the Ring radius R and Core radius r are defined as half the classical electron radius  $r_c$ :
    \begin{equation*}
        r_c = \frac{1}{2} R_e.
    \end{equation*}
    This simplification aligns with established models of vortex structures in fluid dynamics~\cite{kleckner2013}.

    \subsection*{Definition of Tangential Velocity $C_e$}
    To conceptualize the electron as a vortex ring, we associate its tangential velocity $C_e$ with its rotational dynamics:
    \begin{equation*}
        C_e = \omega_c r_c.
    \end{equation*}
    Substituting $\omega_c = \frac{m_e c^2}{\hbar}$ and $r_c = \frac{1}{2} R_e$, we find:
    \begin{equation*}
        C_e = \left( \frac{m_e c^2}{\hbar} \right) \left( \frac{1}{2} \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 m_e c^2} \right).
    \end{equation*}
    Simplifying by canceling $m_e c^2$ yields:
    \begin{equation*}
        C_e = \frac{1}{2} \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar}.\label{eq:C_e-from-compton}
    \end{equation*}
    This result directly links $C_e$ to the fine-structure constant \cite{vinen2024}.

    \subsection*{Physical Interpretation}
    The tangential velocity $C_e$ embodies the rotational speed at the electron's vortex boundary. Its value, approximately:
    \begin{equation*}
        C_e \approx 1.0938 \times 10^6 \ \text{m/s},
    \end{equation*}
    is consistent with the experimentally observed fine-structure constant $\alpha \approx 1/137$~\cite{ricca1998}.

    \subsection*{Conclusion}
    The derivation presented elucidates the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ using fundamental classical principles, including the electron's classical radius, Compton angular frequency, and vortex tangential velocity. The result:
    \begin{equation*}
        \alpha = \frac{2 C_e}{c},
    \end{equation*}
    reveals a profound geometric and physical connection underpinning electromagnetic interactions.
    This perspective enriches our understanding of $\alpha$ and highlights the deep ties between classical mechanics and quantum electrodynamics.


    \section*{Derivation of the VAM Gravitational Constant \(  G_\text{swirl} \)}

    \subsection*{Introduction}
    In the Vortex Æther Model (VAM), gravitational interactions arise from vorticity dynamics in a superfluidic Æther medium rather than from mass-induced spacetime curvature. This leads to a modification of the gravitational constant, which we denote as \(  G_\text{swirl} \), as a function of vortex field parameters.

    To derive \(  G_\text{swirl} \), we assume that gravitational effects emerge from vortex-induced energy density rather than mass-energy tensor formulations. The fundamental relation between vorticity, circulation, and energy density will be used to establish an equivalent gravitational constant in VAM \cite{onsager_superfluid, barcelo_superfluid, moffatt_helicity}.

    \subsection*{Vortex-Induced Energy Density}
    In classical fluid dynamics, vorticity is defined as the curl of velocity:
    \begin{equation*}
        \vec{\omega} = \nabla \times \vec{v}
    \end{equation*}
    where \( \vec{\omega} \) represents the vorticity field.

    The corresponding vorticity energy density is given by:
    \begin{equation*}
        U_\text{vortex} = \frac{1}{2} \rho_\text{\ae} |\vec{\omega}|^2
    \end{equation*}
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( \rho_\text{\ae} \) is the density of the Æther medium,
        \item \( |\vec{\omega}|^2 \) is the squared vorticity magnitude.
    \end{itemize}

    Since vorticity magnitude scales with core tangential velocity as:
    \begin{equation*}
        |\vec{\omega}|^2 \sim \frac{C_e^2}{r_c^2}
    \end{equation*}
    we obtain an approximate energy density for the vortex field:
    \begin{equation*}
        U_\text{vortex} \approx \frac{C_e^2}{2 r_c^2}.
    \end{equation*}

    \subsection*{Gravitational Constant from Vorticity}
    In standard General Relativity (GR), Newton's gravitational constant \( G \) appears in:
    \begin{equation*}
        F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}.
    \end{equation*}

    In VAM, we assume that the gravitational constant \(  G_\text{swirl} \) is defined in terms of \textbf{vorticity energy density} rather than mass-energy.

    Since gravitational force scales with \textbf{energy density per unit mass}, we set:
    \begin{equation*}
        G_\text{swirl} \sim \frac{U_\text{vortex} c^n}{F_{\max}},
    \end{equation*}
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( c^n \) represents relativistic corrections,
        \item \( F_{\max} \) is the maximum force in VAM, set to approximately \textbf{29 N} \cite{schiller_max_force}.
    \end{itemize}

    Substituting \( U_\text{vortex} \):
    \begin{equation*}
        G_\text{swirl} \sim \frac{\left( \frac{C_e^2}{2 r_c^2} \right) c^n}{F_{\max}}.
    \end{equation*}

    The choice of \( n \) depends on whether we use \textbf{Planck length} (\( l_p^2 \)) or \textbf{Planck time} (\( t_p^2 \)).

    \subsection*{Two Possible Forms of \(  G_\text{swirl} \)}
    \subsection*{Form 1: Using Planck Length}
    The Planck length is defined as:
    \begin{equation*}
        l_p^2 = \frac{\hbar G}{c^3}.
    \end{equation*}

    Using \( c^3 l_p^2 \) as the relativistic correction factor, we obtain:
    \begin{equation*}
        G_\text{swirl} = \frac{C_e c^3 l_p^2}{2 F_{\max} r_c^2}.
    \end{equation*}

    \subsection*{Form 2: Using Planck Time}
    The Planck time is given by:
    \begin{equation*}
        t_p^2 = \frac{\hbar G}{c^5}.
    \end{equation*}

    Using \( c^5 t_p^2 \) as the relativistic correction factor, we obtain:
    \begin{equation*}
        G_\text{swirl} = \frac{C_e c^5 t_p^2}{2 F_{\max} r_c^2}.
    \end{equation*}

    \subsection*{Physical Interpretation of \(  G_\text{swirl} \)}
    These formulations of the gravitational constant in VAM highlight a fundamental difference from GR:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Gravity is not driven by mass-energy, but by \textbf{vortex energy density} \cite{barcelo_superfluid}.
        \item \(  G_\text{swirl} \) scales with the core vortex velocity \( C_e \), linking gravity directly to vorticity \cite{moffatt_helicity}.
        \item The \textbf{maximum force \( F_{\max} \)} (\approx29 N) acts as a natural cutoff, limiting the strength of gravitational interactions \cite{schiller_max_force}.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection*{Conclusion}
    We have derived two equivalent formulations of \(  G_\text{swirl} \) using \textbf{Planck scale physics} and \textbf{vortex energy density principles} in VAM. The final expressions:
    \begin{equation*}
        G_\text{swirl} = \frac{C_e c^3 l_p^2}{2 F_{\max} r_c^2}
    \end{equation*}
    and
    \begin{equation*}
        G_\text{swirl} = \frac{C_e c^5 t_p^2}{2 F_{\max} r_c^2}
    \end{equation*}
    demonstrate that gravitational interactions in VAM are governed by vorticity rather than mass-induced curvature.



    \subsection{Vorticity-Based Reformulation of General Relativity Laws in a 3D Absolute Time Framework}

    \subsection*{Vorticity as the Fundamental Gravitational Interaction}

    General Relativity (GR) describes gravity as a result of \textbf{spacetime curvature}, governed by Einstein's field equations:

    \begin{equation*}
        G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}.
    \end{equation*}

    However, in the Vortex Æther Model (VAM), \textbf{gravity is not caused by curvature} but by \textbf{vorticity-induced pressure gradients in an inviscid Æther}. Instead of using a \textbf{4D metric tensor}, we define gravity as a 3D vorticity field \( \omega \), where mass acts as a localized vortex concentration.

    \subsection*{Replacing Einstein's Equations with a 3D Vorticity Field Equation}

    We replace the Einstein curvature equations with a \textbf{3D vorticity-Poisson equation}, where the gravitational potential \( \Phi_v \) is related to vorticity magnitude:

    \begin{equation*}
        \nabla^2 \Phi_v = - \rho_\text{Æ} |\omega|^2.
    \end{equation*}

    Here:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  \( \Phi_v \) is the \textbf{vorticity-induced gravitational potential}.
        \item  \( \rho_\text{\ae} \) is the \textbf{local Æther density}.
        \item  \( |\omega|^2 = (\nabla \times v)^2 \) is the \textbf{vorticity magnitude}.
    \end{itemize}

    Instead of \textbf{mass-energy tensor components}, gravity is determined by the \textbf{local vorticity density}.



    \subsection{Motion in VAM: Replacing Geodesics with Vortex Streamlines}

    In GR, test particles follow \textbf{geodesics in curved spacetime}. In VAM, particles follow \textbf{vortex streamlines}, governed by the \textbf{vorticity transport equation}:

    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{D\omega}{Dt} = (\omega \cdot \nabla) v - (\nabla \cdot v) \omega.
    \end{equation*}

    This replaces \textbf{spacetime curvature} with \textbf{fluid-dynamic vorticity transport} \cite{lamb_hydrodynamics, feynman_superfluid}.



    \subsection*{Frame-Dragging as a 3D Vortex Effect}

    In General Relativity, frame-dragging is described using the \textbf{Kerr metric}, which predicts that spinning masses drag spacetime along with them. In VAM, this effect is caused by \textbf{vortex interactions in the Æther}.

    We replace the Kerr metric with the \textbf{vorticity-induced rotational velocity field}:

    \begin{equation*}
        \Omega_\text{vortex} = \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi r^2},
    \end{equation*}

    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( \Gamma = \oint v \cdot dl \) is the \textbf{circulation of the vortex}.
        \item \( r \) is the \textbf{radial distance from the vortex core}.
    \end{itemize}

    This ensures that frame-dragging emerges \textbf{naturally} from vorticity rather than requiring \textbf{spacetime warping}.



    \subsection{Replacing Gravitational Time Dilation with Vorticity Effects}

    In GR, time dilation is caused by \textbf{spacetime curvature}, leading to:

    \begin{equation*}
        dt_\text{GR} = dt \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}}.
    \end{equation*}

    In VAM, time dilation is caused by \textbf{vorticity-induced energy gradients}, leading to:

    \begin{equation*}
        dt_\text{VAM} = \frac{dt}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{C_e^2}{c^2} e^{-r/r_c} - \frac{\Omega^2}{c^2} e^{-r/r_c}}},
    \end{equation*}

    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  \( C_e \) is the \textbf{vortex core tangential velocity}.
        \item  \( \Omega \) is the \textbf{local vorticity angular velocity}.
    \end{itemize}


    This formula eliminates the need for \textbf{mass-based time dilation} and instead relies purely on \textbf{fluid dynamic principles}.


        \section*{VAM Derivation of Flat Galactic Rotation Velocity}

        In the Vortex \AE{}ther Model, the asymptotic flat rotation velocity $v_{\text{flat}}$ observed in spiral galaxies is not attributed to dark matter, but instead emerges from the interplay between Newtonian gravitational potential and swirl-induced pressure gradients. Assuming a balance between Newtonian attraction and vortex-based outward tension, we derive:

        \[
            \frac{G M}{r} \sim r \cdot \frac{C_e^2}{L^2} \Rightarrow
            v_{\text{flat}}^2 = \left( \frac{G M C_e^2}{L^2} \right)^{1/2} \Rightarrow
            \boxed{v_{\text{flat}} = \left( \frac{G M C_e^2}{L} \right)^{1/4}}
        \]

        where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  $M$ is the enclosed mass,
            \item  $C_e$ is the vortex core tangential velocity,
            \item  $L$ is an effective length scale (e.g. $L \sim r_c R_d$).
        \end{itemize}

        This formula reproduces typical galactic flat rotation speeds ($\sim$200 km/s) without exotic matter. The fourth-root dependence of $v_{\text{flat}}$ on $M$ establishes a VAM-based analog to the Tully--Fisher relation:

        \[
            v_{\text{flat}}^4 \propto M
        \]

        but grounded in fluid dynamic quantities rather than empirical fitting. This vortex-based scaling law is testable against rotation curve datasets and offers a falsifiable prediction for baryon-only spiral systems.

        As a historical and conceptual comparison, this approach parallels the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theory proposed by Milgrom~\cite{milgrom1983mond1, milgrom1983mond2}, which modifies Newtonian gravity in the low-acceleration regime to explain flat rotation curves without dark matter. However, VAM derives similar effects from an underlying physical æther field, introducing no additional empirical constants.

        \section*{Conclusion}

        Using quantum constants to define \AE{}ther properties bridges microscopic and cosmological theories. The refined value of $\rho_{\text{\ae}}^{\text{(fluid)}}$ supports both theoretical elegance and experimental plausibility. The residual swirl field offers a predictive, falsifiable alternative to dark matter and MOND.




        \subsection*{Summary: A 3D Vorticity-Based Alternative to General Relativity}

    The Vortex Æther Model replaces the \textbf{4D spacetime formalism of General Relativity} with a \textbf{3D vorticity-driven description}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Gravity} is not caused by \textbf{curved spacetime} but by \textbf{vorticity-induced pressure gradients}.
        \item \textbf{Geodesic motion} is replaced by \textbf{vortex streamlines} in an inviscid Æther.
        \item \textbf{Frame-dragging} is explained through \textbf{circulation velocity in vorticity fields}, rather than through Kerr spacetime.
        \item \textbf{Time dilation} arises from \textbf{energy gradients in vortex structures}, not from mass-induced curvature.
    \end{itemize}

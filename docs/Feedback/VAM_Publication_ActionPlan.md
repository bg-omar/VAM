## üü¢ PRIORITY PAPERS (Chronological Order of Reading)

### 1. üìú *Einstein and the √Üther*

**Goal**: Establish historical and philosophical legitimacy of the VAM through Einstein‚Äôs writings.

#### ‚úÖ Action Steps:
- [ ] Add **scholarly references** (Don Howard, John Norton) to support historical claims.
- [ ] Create a **table** comparing: Einstein‚Äôs non-mechanical √¶ther, VAM √¶ther, and modern field vacuum theories.
- [ ] Include a **timeline diagram** showing Einstein‚Äôs evolving views on √¶ther.
- [ ] Reframe Einstein quotes with **critical commentary**, distinguishing metaphor from model alignment.
- [ ] Position paper as **philosophical context**, not scientific proof.
- [ ] Submit as companion piece to scientific VAM papers.

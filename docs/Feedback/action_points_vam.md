# Action Points to Strengthen the Vortex Æther Model Manuscripts

| # | Priority | Action | Target Paper(s) | Deliverable / Metric |
|---|----------|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **1** | **High** | **Add a concise “Core Equations & Postulates” section** summarizing continuity, Euler, vorticity conservation, and the Poisson-type gravity equation. | All (place in each intro or as a shared appendix) | ≤1‑page boxed summary with numbered postulates + governing equations |
| **2** | **High** | **Derive (or document) the Poisson‑like equation**  ∇²Φ₍ᵥ₎=–ρₐ‖ω‖² from Euler+Bernoulli; move full derivation to an appendix. | *SwirlClocks*; *TimeDilation* | Step‑by‑step derivation with assumptions clearly stated |
| **3** | **High** | **Explain every model constant** (Cₑ, Fₘₐₓ, r_c, β, μ(r)… ) in a “Symbols&PhysicalMeaning” table; note whether fitted or derived. | Benchmarking; SwirlClocks | One consolidated table with units+origin notes |
| **4** | **High** | **Clarify empirical deviations & predictions** – make a table contrasting GR vs VAM where they differ (e.g. light‑bending dispersion, Lorentz‑violation scale). | Benchmarking (add to conclusion) | Table with magnitude estimates & experiment references |
| **5** | **Medium** | **Separate speculative quantum/LENR content into its own future‑work section or a new paper.** | SwirlClocks; Einstein&Æther | Revised abstracts free of quantum/LENR claims; ≤3 lines pointing to future study |
| **6** | **Medium** | **Streamline scope per manuscript** (keep each focused: history, gravity derivations, benchmarking, extended theory). Remove digressions. | All | Abstract aligns 1‑to‑1 with section flow; no off‑topic paragraphs |
| **7** | **Medium** | **Insert a “Limitations & Open Problems” subsection** discussing quantum formulation, cosmology, precision Lorentz tests. | SwirlClocks; Benchmarking | ≈½‑page candid discussion |
| **8** | **Medium** | **Provide a brief rationale for compressible‑æther extension** and derive the gravitational‑wave wave equation from linearized compressible Euler. | Benchmarking (GW section) | New derivation + citation to fluid‑wave literature |
| **9** | **Low** | **Ensure figures use English labels; standardize vector notation** (bold or arrow) and fix any Dutch words (“Rotatie”, “Translatie”). | TimeDilation (Fig.1) | Updated figures embedded in final PDF |
| **10** | **Low** | **Add literature context**—cite modern analog‑gravity, emergent gravity, and Lorentz‑Poincaré ether sources to show awareness. | Einstein&Æther intro; all refs | +5–10 contemporary citations with explanatory footnotes |

## Suggested Workflow

$$ \frac{1}{2} $$

1. **Week1–2:** Implement Actions1–3 (core equations, derivation appendix, symbol table).  
2. **Week3:** Finalize Action4 (prediction table) and Action7 (limitations section).  
3. **Week4:** Execute Actions5–6 (scope cleanup, speculative split).  
4. **Week5:** Complete Action8 (GW derivation) and Action10 (literature).  
5. **Week6:** Polish figures & notation (Action9) and circulate revised drafts for internal review.

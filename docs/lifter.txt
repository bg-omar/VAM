 found a video showing clear experiment with the lifter, these are the conclusions:
setup: 

ðŸ”¹ 1. Oscillator Circuit (Image 1)
Based on a 74HC14 Schmitt trigger inverter configured as an astable multivibrator (oscillator).
Generates a square wave signal using:
A capacitor (100nF),
A feedback resistor (470k),
A timing resistor (10k).
This signal is sent to the IN pin of the IR2104 gate driver.

ðŸ”¹ 2. IR2104-Based Half-Bridge Driver (Image 2)
The IR2104 drives a pair of IRFP460 N-channel MOSFETs.
High-side and low-side MOSFETs switch a DC voltage in half-bridge mode.
Bootstrap capacitor (100ÂµF) is used for high-side gate drive.
Gate resistors (10Î©) are included to dampen switching transients.
Powered from a +16V supply via 1N4007 diode.

ðŸ”¹ 3. AC-DC Converter & Bus Capacitor Stage (Image 3)
A 220V AC input is rectified by a 25A 1000V bridge rectifier.
Output is filtered by large electrolytic capacitors (470ÂµF, 400V).
This supplies high-voltage DC (likely around 310V DC) to the half-bridge.

ðŸ”¹ 4. High-Voltage Cockcroft-Walton Multiplier (Image 4)
A voltage multiplier chain using:
BY550-1000 diodes
47ÂµF 350V capacitors
250 pieces each, suggesting many stages of multiplication.
Converts the pulsed high-voltage AC from the half-bridge into a very high DC voltage.

ðŸ”¹ 5. HV Output Stage with Load (Image 5)
Output is 30,000V DC as shown on the voltmeter.
Includes a 30MÎ© bleeder/load resistor.
Final output of the voltage multiplier chain.

âš¡ Final System Summary
This setup is a DIY high-voltage DC generator (like a Cockcroftâ€“Walton generator) using:
IR2104 gate driver + IRFP460 half-bridge for high-voltage pulsed DC,
Cockcroftâ€“Walton voltage multiplier to step up to ~30kV DC,
Oscillator using 74HC14 for frequency generation.



Materials:
rounded balsa stripes,

Thrust starts at aprox 15kv
Time in video discharge Spark: 00:06:57:27 (duration 2 frames)
Breakdown voltage = 25000V
it  breaks down at thrust -5 gram 
@ Time = 00:06:57:29 until 00:06:58:09 The voltage dropt to 8Kv (10 frames at 30fps)
@ 00:06:58:10 the voltage is at 8Kv while the thrust is still at -6 Grams
@ 00:06:58:17 The Voltage is rising again and at 10kv and the thrust has stopped dropping to -4 gram
Next step - polarity reversing

Same breakdown voltage = 25000V
and same thrust = 6 g
was registered with reversed polarity
Next step - increasing gap to 35 mm

With 35 mm gap
reached voltage = 30000V
current = between 10 and 15 uA
maximal thrust = 10 g
Next step -
paper shield between electrodes

With paper shield
thrust is increasing more than twice
maximal thrust  ~22g 
reached voltage = 30000V
current = between 10 and 15 uA
Next step -
glass shield between electrodes

With glass shield
maximal thrust  ~32g 
reached voltage = 30000V
current = between 10 and 15 uA
registered thrust is 20g/1W
(till corona discharge appears)
Unwanted corona discharge
can be seen in darkness

\subsection{Relation to the Bohr Model Velocity}\label{subsec:Relation-to-the-Bohr-Model-Velocity}
\paragraph{Vorticity in a Simplified ``Rigid-Body'' Model:}

In fluid mechanics, the vorticity $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{\omega} = \nabla \times \mathbf{v}\label{eq:vorticity}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity field of the fluid.
For an idealized rigid-body rotation about the $z$-axis with constant angular velocity $\Omega$, the velocity field at radius $r$ in cylindrical coordinates is

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{v}(r) = \Omega \hat{z} \times \mathbf{r} = \Omega(-y\hat{x} + x\hat{y}) \quad \Rightarrow \quad |
    \mathbf{v}(r)| = \Omega r.\label{eq:cylindrical-velocity}
\end{equation}

A standard result is that the corresponding vorticity magnitude is
\begin{equation}
    |\boldsymbol{\omega}| = \left| \nabla \times \mathbf{v} \right| = 2\Omega.\label{eq:vortcity-magnitude}
\end{equation}

Hence, if the tangential (orbital) velocity at radius $r$ is $v_\text{tangential} = \Omega r$, the local vorticity is:

\begin{equation}
    \omega = 2\Omega = \frac{2v_\text{tangential}}{r}.\label{eq:2velocity}
\end{equation}

Therefore, one sometimes says ``the vorticity is twice the angular velocity'' or equivalently ``the vorticity (multiplied by $r$) is twice the tangential velocity.''

\subsubsection*{Standard Bohr Orbit (Classical Picture)}
In the simplified (pre-Schr\"odinger) Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, the electron in the ground state ($n=1$) is classically pictured as moving on a circle of radius $a_0$ (the Bohr radius) with speed $v_1$.
One derives:

\begin{equation}
    v_1 = \alpha c \approx 2.1877 \times 10^6 \text{ m/s},\label{eq:tangetial-velocity}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha \approx 1/137.036$ is the fine-structure constant, and $c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$ is the speed of light.

\subsubsection*{Identifying This ``Speed'' as Part of a Vortex Flow}
From a fluid-mechanical or vortex standpoint (rather than a literal ``point mass in orbit''), one could regard:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $v_1$ as the local tangential speed of a circulating flow at a ``radius'' $r = a_0$.
    \item $\omega$ as the local vorticity (i.e., twice the angular velocity) of that circulating flow.
\end{itemize}

Hence, if the flow near radius $r$ is seen as a rigid rotation with angular velocity $\omega$, then
\begin{equation}
    v_1 = \Omega r, \quad \omega = 2\Omega = \frac{2v_1}{r}.\label{eq:angular-velocity}
\end{equation}
In that sense, the electron’s ``orbital speed'' in the Bohr picture is no longer just a ``translational velocity'' along a circle but rather the tangential velocity of a vortex flow, whose local vorticity is $2 v_1 / r$.

\subsubsection*{Caveats from Quantum Mechanics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Wavefunction over Orbits:} Modern quantum mechanics replaces the simplistic Bohr ``orbiting electron'' with a wavefunction, typically the hydrogenic ground state $\psi_{1s}(r)$.
    This does not literally revolve in a circle with speed $v_1$.
    \item \textbf{Vortex Interpretations:} Vortex-based approaches to quantum phenomena (e.g., ``Madelung fluid'' pictures, pilot-wave hydrodynamics analogies, or various vortex theories) can sometimes interpret quantum states in terms of fluid-like velocity fields.
    But these remain analogies unless the fluid equations can be shown to match quantum mechanical predictions.
    \item \textbf{Bohr Model as a Teaching Tool:} Despite its historical importance, the Bohr model is mainly a stepping stone to deeper quantum theory.
    Nonetheless, it yields correct orders of magnitude for ground-state energies and ``speeds,'' which can be reinterpreted in fluid-like language if one chooses.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Summary:}
The classical Bohr velocity $v_1$ for the ground-state electron in hydrogen (about $2.18 \times 10^6 \text{ m/s}$) can be reinterpreted as the tangential speed at some radius in a fluid vortex.

\begin{itemize}
    \item In a rigidly rotating vortex, the vorticity is $2\Omega$, and at any radius $r$, the tangential velocity is $\Omega r$.
    Thus, vorticity $\omega$ is ``2 times the angular velocity,'' or $\omega r$ is ``2 times the tangential velocity.'' It is this tangential velocity that we define as one of our new constants.
    Because of the similarity between the speed of light and the tangential velocity of an electron we will identify it with $C_e$.
    This identifier is not just arbitrary, but can be explained by a constant based on the electron.
    It will now also become clear that this tangential velocity is not just a speed, but a fundamental property of the \AE ther connected to the speed of light by the fine-structure constant $\alpha = \frac{2 C_e}{c}$.
    \item Consequently, one might say ``the electron’s speed in the Bohr model is not purely a translational speed but rather the tangential speed associated with the local vorticity.''
\end{itemize}

Mathematically:
\begin{equation}
    \boxed{ \omega = \nabla \times \mathbf{v} = 2\Omega,\quad v_{\text{tangential}} = \Omega r, \quad \omega r = 2 v_{\text{tangential}}. }\label{eq:2-times-tangential}
\end{equation}


\paragraph{Key Takeaway:} From a purely fluid‐mechanical viewpoint, a uniform circular velocity field has $\omega = 2 \,\Omega$.
Thus, it is natural to say “the electron’s Bohr velocity can be identified with the tangential velocity in a vortex whose vorticity is $2\,v/r$.” In standard quantum mechanics, this is at best a useful analogy, but it can help conceptualize why one might see the Bohr velocity as “vorticity” rather than plain translational motion.

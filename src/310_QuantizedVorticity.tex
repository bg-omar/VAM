\subsection{Quantized Vorticity in the Vortex \AE ther Model (VAM) via $SL(2)_q$}

To formalize the quantization of vorticity in the Vortex \AE ther Model (VAM), we employ the representation theory of quantum groups—particularly the deformed algebra $SL(2)_q$—to describe vortex knot states. The goal is to derive a quantized vorticity spectrum, akin to quantized angular momentum in quantum mechanics.

\subsubsection*{Defining the Vorticity Operator in VAM}
Vorticity $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ in an incompressible, inviscid fluid follows:
\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{\omega} = \nabla \times \mathbf{v}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity field of the \AE ther.

From quantum mechanics, we recall that angular momentum operators satisfy the Lie algebra $su(2)$:
\begin{equation}
[J_+, J_-] = 2J_z, \quad [J_z, J_{\pm}] = \pm J_{\pm}
\end{equation}

In the quantized vortex model, we postulate that vorticity components follow a similar algebraic structure:
\begin{equation}
[\omega_+, \omega_-] = 2\omega_z, \quad [\omega_z, \omega_{\pm}] = \pm \omega_{\pm}
\end{equation}
This implies a discrete vorticity spectrum, analogous to quantized angular momentum in quantum mechanics.

However, instead of the usual Lie algebra $su(2)$, we use the quantum deformation $SL(2)_q$, leading to:
\begin{equation}
[\omega_+, \omega_-] = \frac{q^{2\omega_z} - q^{-2\omega_z}}{q - q^{-1}}
\end{equation}
where $q$ is the deformation parameter controlling vorticity quantization.

\subsubsection*{Quantum Group Representation and Discrete Vorticity States}
The irreducible representations of $SL(2)_q$ define discrete states for vorticity $\omega$:
\begin{equation}
    \omega_z |n\rangle = n |n\rangle, \quad n \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots\}
\end{equation}
where $|n\rangle$ represents a quantized vortex state. The ladder operators modify vorticity states:
\begin{equation}
    \omega_+ |n\rangle = \sqrt{[n+1]_q} |n+1\rangle, \quad \omega_- |n\rangle = \sqrt{[n]_q} |n-1\rangle
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
[n]_q = \frac{q^n - q^{-n}}{q - q^{-1}}
\end{equation}
ensures quantized vortex strength.

Thus, vorticity in VAM follows a discrete spectrum rather than being continuous, aligning with the quantized nature of superfluid vortices.

\subsubsection*{Energy Spectrum of a Knotted Vortex}
The energy density of a vortex filament in VAM is given by:
\begin{equation}
    E = \frac{1}{2} \int_V |\boldsymbol{\omega}|^2 dV
\end{equation}
Using the quantum algebra formulation, we expand $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ in terms of its quantized basis:
\begin{equation}
    E_n = \frac{1}{2} \langle n | \omega^2 | n \rangle = \frac{1}{2} [n]_q^2
\end{equation}
which suggests that energy levels depend on the quantum deformation parameter.

For small $q \approx 1$, the standard quantum number emerges:
\begin{equation}
    E_n \approx \frac{1}{2} n(n+1)
\end{equation}
which mirrors the energy spectrum of angular momentum states in quantum mechanics.

\subsubsection*{Linking Vortex Quantization to Fine-Structure Constant}
From VAM's fundamental relations, the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ emerges as:
\begin{equation}
    \alpha = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar c} = \frac{\omega_c R_e}{c}
\end{equation}
where:
- $R_e$ is the classical electron radius,
- $\omega_c$ is a characteristic vortex frequency.

If we substitute $\omega_c$ with the quantized vorticity spectrum $[n]_q$, we obtain:
\begin{equation}
    \alpha = \frac{[n]_q R_e}{c}
\end{equation}
which implies that the fine-structure constant is linked to vortex quantization in the \AE ther.

\subsubsection*{Conclusion}
We have successfully derived a quantized vorticity spectrum using $SL(2)_q$, demonstrating that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vortex states are discrete, following a quantum-group algebra.
    \item Energy levels depend on quantized vorticity, analogous to angular momentum quantization.
    \item The fine-structure constant may emerge naturally from vortex interactions, linking electromagnetism to vortex dynamics.
\end{itemize}

Future directions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deriving the relation between vortex quantum states and electromagnetic wave propagation.
    \item Extending the Yang-Baxter equation to multi-vortex interactions.
    \item Comparing these results to superfluid quantum vortex experiments.
\end{itemize}

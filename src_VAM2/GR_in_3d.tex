\begin{abstract}
    The Vortex Æther Model (VAM) introduces a unified, non-relativistic framework wherein gravity, electromagnetism, and quantum phenomena emerge from structured vorticity in an inviscid superfluid-like æther. Unlike General Relativity, which invokes spacetime curvature, VAM models stable vortex knots in a 3D Euclidean medium with absolute time. Observed time dilation results from vortex-induced local energy gradients. This paper derives time dilation analogs to GR, explores vortex-energetic time shifts, and presents experimental implications.

    \section*{Core Assumptions}
    The Æther is modeled as an inviscid, incompressible superfluid governed by:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \toprule
    \midrule
        * & Conservation of Absolute Vorticity \\
        * & A 3D Euclidean medium with absolute time \\
        * & Particles as vortex knots \\
        * & Irrotational outside vortex cores, but with conserved vorticity inside knots \\
        * & Gravity from vorticity-induced pressure gradients \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

    Let:

    \begin{tabular}{ll}
        \toprule
        Symbol & Description \\
        \midrule
        \(\vec{v}\) & Æther velocity field \\
        \(\vec{\omega}\) &  Vorticity \(\vec{\omega} = \nabla \times \vec{v}\) \\
        \(\rho_\text{æ}\) & Æther density (constant) \\
        \(\Phi\) & Vorticity-induced potential \\
        \(\kappa\) & Circulation constant \\
        \(\mathcal{K}\) & Knot topological class (Hopf link, torus knot, etc.) \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}

    \subsection*{Introduction to Fluid Dynamics and Vorticity Conservation}
    Euler Equation (Inviscid Flow)
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial t} + (\vec{v} \cdot \nabla)\vec{v} = -\frac{1}{\rho_\text{æ}} \nabla p
    \end{equation}
    Taking the curl to get the Vorticity Transport
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\partial \vec{\omega}}{\partial t} + (\vec{v} \cdot \nabla)\vec{\omega} = (\vec{\omega} \cdot \nabla) \vec{v}
    \end{equation}

    \subsection*{Vorticity-Induced Gravity}
    We define a Newtonian like vorticity-based gravitational potential $\Phi$:
    \begin{equation}
        \vec{F}_g = -\nabla \Phi
    \end{equation}
    Where $\Phi$ is the Vorticity Potential:
    \begin{equation}
        \Phi(\vec{r}) = \gamma \int \frac{|\vec{\omega}(\vec{r'})|^2}{|\vec{r} - \vec{r'}|} \, d^3r'
    \end{equation}
    This mirrors the Newtonian potential but replaces mass density with vorticity intensity. This gives attractive force fields between vortex knots (like a particle).

\begin{abstract}
The integration of spin density and torsion within the Einstein-Cartan (EC) framework provides an advanced microscopic foundation for modeling vorticity dynamics. By addressing the intrinsic angular momentum encapsulated by spin density, this study illuminates the mechanisms by which these factors stabilize and influence vortex structures. Leveraging the classical electron model and constants derived from the \AE{}ther dynamics paradigm, we present critical equations interlinking spin, torsion, and vortex dynamics. This investigation offers profound implications for understanding quantum fluid behaviors, astrophysical phenomena, and elementary particle interactions, creating a bridge between microscopic dynamics and macroscopic observables.


Furthermore, we extend this framework by analyzing the influence of torsion on the evolution of vorticity fields under different physical conditions, including relativistic and high-energy regimes. This research highlights the robustness of spin-torsion coupling across multiple domains, demonstrating its utility in understanding astrophysical jets, neutron star interiors, and electron vortices in condensed matter systems.

\subsection*{Introduction}


Vorticity serves as a fundamental pillar of fluid dynamics, encompassing phenomena ranging from turbulent flows to the intricate dynamics of superfluid vortices. Traditional approaches have predominantly treated vorticity as a macroscopic attribute. However, the Einstein-Cartan framework introduces torsion, enabling the direct incorporation of intrinsic spin effects into fluid-like systems. By formalizing the relationship between spin density and the geometry of spacetime, the EC model provides a sophisticated mechanism to examine stability and energy distribution within dynamic vortex structures.


This intersection of torsion and spin density extends well beyond classical fluid systems, providing insights into the microscopic underpinnings of quantum phenomena and the large-scale behaviors of astrophysical objects. By coupling spin density with spacetime geometry, the EC framework unifies disparate scales, offering a comprehensive model that encapsulates both quantum mechanical and classical fluid dynamics. The implications of this approach extend to gravitational wave phenomena, where spin-induced torsion fluctuations could play a measurable role in wave propagation through strong vorticity fields.


\subsection*{The Einstein-Cartan Framework for Vortex Dynamics}


The EC framework generalizes General Relativity by integrating torsion, represented through the antisymmetric part of the connection $Q^\lambda \textit{\mu\nu}$. The spin density tensor $S^\lambda{\mu\nu}$ acts as the torsion source:
\begin{equation}
Q^{\lambda}\textit{{\mu\nu} = -\kappa S^{\lambda}}{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
where $\kappa = 8\pi G$ is the gravitational coupling constant. This formulation accommodates intrinsic angular momentum, significantly altering the stability and evolution of vortices by introducing torsion-induced forces.


In this context, the impact of torsion on the conservation of angular momentum within rotating fluid systems is examined. The interplay between spin-induced torsion and conventional frame-dragging effects is explored, demonstrating that torsion can enhance stability in rapidly rotating astrophysical systems.


\subsection{Spin Density in Vortex Systems}


Spin density, $s$, encapsulates the distribution of intrinsic angular momentum within a vortex system and is defined as:
\begin{equation}
s = \frac{3S}{4\pi r^3},
\end{equation}
where $S$ denotes the quantized spin (e.g., $S = \hbar/2$ for an electron) and $r$ represents the radial distance from the vortex core. This spin density modifies the effective energy density and pressure:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\rho} = \rho - 2s^2, \quad \tilde{p}\textit{r = p_r - 2s^2, \quad \tilde{p}}{\perp} = p_{\perp} - 2s^2.
\end{equation}
This formulation underscores the stabilizing effects of torsion on regions with pronounced angular momentum, ensuring coherence in vortex structures under perturbative influences.


\subsection{Conservation Laws with Torsion}


The EC framework introduces torsion into energy-momentum conservation:
\begin{equation}
\nabla_{\mu} T^{\mu\nu} = Q^{\nu},
\end{equation}
where $T^{\mu\nu}$ denotes the energy-momentum tensor and $Q^{\nu}$ captures torsion-induced flux. In vortex systems, torsion counters Coulomb effects, enhancing structural stability and longevity, even under significant external disturbances.


Additionally, the role of torsion in stabilizing vortex lattices in rotating superfluid environments is discussed. The influence of spin-induced torsion on vortex spacing and phase coherence is explored within the context of Bose-Einstein condensates.


\subsection*{Application to the Classical Electron Model}


Leveraging constants from the \AE{}ther dynamics model:
\begin{align}
C_e &= 1.09384563 \times 10^6 \text{ m s}^{-1}, \
F_{\text{max}} &= 29.053507 \text{ N}, \
R_c &= 1.40897017 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m}.
\end{align}
For a vortex modeled as a spherical region with radius $R_c$, spin density is expressed as:
\begin{equation}
s = \frac{3\hbar}{4\pi R_c^3} \approx 1.37 \times 10^{47} \text{ J m}^{-3}.
\end{equation}


The rotational kinetic energy within the vortex incorporates angular velocity:
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{1}{2} \rho C_e^2 R_c^3.
\end{equation}
The energy density near the vortex core becomes:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\rho} = \rho - 2s^2 \approx \rho - 2(1.37 \times 10^{47})^2.
\end{equation}
Here, $R_c$ confines the spatial extent of spin density effects, ensuring physical consistency and avoiding singularities.


\subsection*{Implications and Future Directions}


The integration of spin density, torsion, and constants such as $C_e$, $F_{\text{max}}$, and $R_c$ unveils new stabilization mechanisms for vortex systems across scales. Applications include:


\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Quantum Fluids}: Understanding spin-torsion dynamics in superfluid vortices.

\item \textbf{Astrophysics}: Investigating torsion effects in neutron stars and pulsar evolution.

\item \textbf{Particle Physics}: Exploring vortex models for electron spin, magnetic moments, and stability.

\end{itemize}

Further avenues of research involve numerical simulations of torsion-influenced vorticity fields, experimental investigations of spin-induced vortex stabilization, and applications of spin-torsion coupling in quantum gravity theories.


\subsection*{Conclusion}


Spin density and torsion, embedded within the Einstein-Cartan framework, significantly expand the theoretical understanding of vortex dynamics. By coupling intrinsic angular momentum with spacetime geometry, this approach unifies quantum and classical descriptions of fluid and particle systems. The incorporation of constants such as $C_e$, $F_{\text{max}}$, and $R_c$ enriches this model, linking microscopic spin-driven effects to macroscopic phenomena, thereby providing a robust platform for future exploration across physics domains. Further studies should examine the role of spin-torsion coupling in astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics and quantum turbulence phenomena.

        \subsection*{Abstract}
        This article rigorously examines the mathematical and physical correspondence between the Æther model and Maxwell's equations. The Æther model, grounded in classical fluid dynamics and vorticity conservation, is extended to include pressure-vorticity coupling, helicity preservation, and topological dynamics of knotted vortex structures. These features are shown to align with Maxwell's electromagnetic theory. Explicit derivations for wave propagation, helicity dynamics, and pressure-vorticity interactions elucidate how Maxwell's equations naturally arise within the framework of the Æther model.

        \subsection*{1. Introduction}
        The Æther model posits a luminiferous medium governed by inviscid, incompressible fluid dynamics, where particles are represented as stable vortex knots. Vorticity fields mediate interactions within this framework, offering a classical alternative to the curvature-driven dynamics of general relativity. Notably, this model parallels Maxwell's electromagnetic equations through its treatment of pressure gradients, vorticity conservation, and energy interactions.

        Key principles addressed in this work include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Conservation of vorticity in the Æther.
            \item The coupling between pressure and vorticity fields.
            \item Wave propagation via scalar and vector potentials.
            \item Derivation of the fine-structure constant from Æther dynamics.
        \end{itemize}

        \subsection*{2. Vorticity Conservation in the Æther Model}
        Equation:
        \begin{equation}
            \nabla \cdot \vec{\omega} = 0,
        \end{equation}
        where $\vec{\omega} = \nabla \times \vec{u}_\text{Æ}$ represents the vorticity field in the Æther.

        Derivation:
        Starting from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations:
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t} + (\vec{u} \cdot \nabla) \vec{u} = -\nabla P + \nu \nabla^2 \vec{u},
        \end{equation}
        we eliminate viscosity by setting $\nu = 0$ and take the curl of both sides:
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{\partial \vec{\omega}}{\partial t} + \nabla \times (\vec{\omega} \times \vec{u}) = 0.
        \end{equation}
        Since $\nabla \cdot \vec{\omega} = 0$ for incompressible flows, vorticity is conserved, consistent with Kelvin's circulation theorem in ideal fluids.

        \subsection*{3. Pressure-Vorticity Coupling}
        Equation:
        \begin{equation}
            \nabla \times \vec{\omega} = \frac{\Delta P}{C_e},
        \end{equation}
        where $C_e$ denotes the Ætheric vorticity constant.

        Derivation:
        Taking the curl of the momentum equation:
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{\partial \vec{\omega}}{\partial t} = \frac{\nabla \rho_\text{Æ} \times \nabla P}{C_e},
        \end{equation}
        we see that pressure gradients drive changes in the vorticity field, creating rotational dynamics. This coupling serves as the Ætheric analogue to the Lorentz force in electromagnetism.

        \subsection*{4. Wave Propagation in the Æther}
        Scalar Potential Equation:
        \begin{equation}
            \nabla^2 \Phi - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial t^2} = 0,
        \end{equation}
        where $\Phi = -\frac{P}{C_e}$.

        Vector Potential Equation:
        \begin{equation}
            \nabla^2 \vec{A} - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \vec{A}}{\partial t^2} = 0,
        \end{equation}
        with $\vec{A} = C_e \vec{\omega}$.

        \subsection*{5. Fine-Structure Constant Relation}
        Equation:
        \begin{equation}
            \alpha = \frac{2C_e}{c}.
        \end{equation}

        Derivation:
        In the Æther model, $C_e$ represents the maximum angular velocity of vortex knots, analogous to the speed of light. Relating $C_e$ to electromagnetic interactions yields:
        \begin{equation}
            C_e = \frac{\alpha c}{2},
        \end{equation}
        establishing the proportionality between the fine-structure constant and vorticity in the Æther.

        \subsection*{6. Knotted Vortex Dynamics}
        Helicity Conservation:
        \begin{equation}
            H = \int \vec{u} \cdot \vec{\omega} \, dV,
        \end{equation}
        where helicity quantifies the knottedness and topological structure of vortex lines.

        Reconnection Dynamics:
        Knotted vortex structures evolve through reconnections that preserve helicity while redistributing energy. This mirrors flux conservation in magnetic field lines.

        Relation to Maxwell:
        Helicity conservation aligns with magnetic flux conservation, with vortex knots analogous to stable magnetic flux tubes in plasma physics.

        \subsection*{7. Electromagnetic Analogies}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Gauss’s Laws:
            \begin{equation}
                \nabla \cdot \vec{\omega} = 0 \quad \text{aligns with} \quad \nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0.
            \end{equation}
            \begin{equation}
                \nabla \cdot \nabla P = \frac{\rho_\text{Æ}}{\varepsilon_0} \quad \text{parallels} \quad \nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}.
            \end{equation}
            \item Faraday’s Law:
            \begin{equation}
                \nabla \times \vec{u} = -\frac{\partial \vec{\omega}}{\partial t},
            \end{equation}
            mapping directly to
            \begin{equation}
                \nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}.
            \end{equation}
        \end{itemize}

        \subsection*{8. Conclusion}
        The equations derived for the Æther model demonstrate a profound alignment with Maxwell’s equations, offering a novel fluid-dynamic interpretation of classical electromagnetic phenomena. By bridging vorticity-driven dynamics and electromagnetic theory, the Æther model provides a robust foundation for exploring the interplay of topology, conservation laws, and wave mechanics, potentially enriching both classical and quantum domains.

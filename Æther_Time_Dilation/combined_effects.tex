\section{Combined Effects and Further Predictions}

Having derived separate time dilation factors for motion through æther and gravitational æther flow, we now consider both effects simultaneously.

\subsection*{Combined Motion and Gravitational Field}

Let a vortex-clock move with velocity $\vec{u}$ in a region where the æther is flowing with velocity $\vec{v}_g$. The effective relative velocity with respect to the local æther flow is:
\[
\vec{v}_{\text{rel}} = \vec{u} - \vec{v}_g.
\]
The observed time dilation is then:
\[
\frac{d\tau}{dt} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{|\vec{v}_{\text{rel}}|^2}{c^2}}. \tag{5}
\]
This formulation smoothly incorporates both special and general relativistic effects into a single expression.

\subsection*{Example: Circular Orbit Time Dilation}

Consider a clock orbiting a mass $M$ at radius $r$. The tangential velocity of the orbit is:
\[
v_{\text{orb}} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}, \quad v_g(r) = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}.
\]
Since the orbital velocity is perpendicular to the radial æther inflow, the relative speed is:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \sqrt{v_{\text{orb}}^2 + v_g^2} = \sqrt{\frac{3GM}{r}}.
\]
Thus, the time dilation becomes:
\[
\frac{d\tau}{dt} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{3GM}{rc^2}}. \tag{6}
\]
This matches the exact result from Schwarzschild geometry for circular orbits.

\subsection*{Implications Near a Horizon}

As $r \to r_s = 2GM/c^2$, the inflow speed $v_g(r)$ approaches $c$, and any static observer's clock slows to zero. The æther flow fully suppresses local vortex rotation, providing a natural mechanism for the "freezing of time" at the event horizon.

\subsection*{Unified Interpretation}

This æther model allows all relativistic time dilation effects to be viewed as consequences of one principle:
\[
\text{Clock rate reduction} \;\propto\; \text{relative motion through æther}.
\]
Whether this relative motion arises from inertial velocity or from ætheric inflow due to nearby mass, the observable consequence is the same. Therefore, we conclude:
\[
\boxed{\frac{d\tau}{dt} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{|\vec{u} - \vec{v}_g|^2}{c^2}}}
\]
as the general time dilation formula for the Vortex Æther Model.

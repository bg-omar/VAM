First, consider time dilation for a particle moving at high speed relative to the æther rest frame. Empirically, we know that a clock moving at velocity $v$ experiences time slower by the Lorentz factor $\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$. In this model, we derive the same effect by analyzing the influence of absolute æther motion on vortex core rotation.

\subsection*{(a) Kinematic Derivation}

Let a vortex be at rest in its own frame $S'$ but moving at velocity $v$ relative to the æther rest frame $S$. In $S'$, the vortex rotates with angular frequency $\omega_0$, and defines proper time $\tau$. Due to Lorentz time dilation, an observer in $S$ sees the clock slow down:
\[
\omega_{\text{obs}} = \omega_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \,.
\]
From the relation between proper and coordinate time,
\[
\frac{d\tau}{dt} = \frac{\omega_{\text{obs}}}{\omega_0} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \,. \tag{2}
\]

This matches the standard SR time dilation formula. In our model, the physical mechanism is that æther motion across the vortex disrupts its swirl rate, slowing the apparent rotation in the æther frame.

\subsection*{(b) Fluid-Dynamic Interpretation}

A complementary interpretation uses compressible flow analogies. In fluid dynamics, a body moving at speed $v$ in a compressible medium with signal speed $c$ experiences distortions proportional to $\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$. This can be thought of as a Doppler time dilation or resistance to maintaining coherent circulation. 

As velocity approaches the æther signal speed $c$, the surrounding flow compresses and resists vortex rotation. Therefore, the angular velocity seen in the æther frame drops, and:
\[
\omega_{\text{obs}} = \omega_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \Rightarrow \frac{d\tau}{dt} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \,. \tag{3}
\]

\subsection*{Implication}

This gives us the relativistic time dilation for a moving clock:
\[
\boxed{\frac{d\tau}{dt} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]
within a Euclidean, æther-based flat space, and matches all special relativity experimental predictions~\cite{Rado2020-aether-Lorentz,Levy2009-aether-clock}.
